        'Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Wikipedia\nContent: Later in his life, Foucault explained that his work was less about analyzing power as a phenomenon than about trying to characterize the different ways in which contemporary society has expressed the use of power to "objectivise subjects". These have taken three broad forms: one involving scientific authority to classify and \'order\' knowledge about human populations; the second has been to categorize and \'normalise\' human subjects (by identifying madness, illness, physical features, and so on); and the third relates to the manner in which the impulse to fashion sexual identities and train one\'s own body to engage in routines and practices ends up reproducing certain patterns within a given society.[190]\nLiterature\n\n'

A persistent theme in Foucault’s work is the relationship between power and knowledge, culminating in his neologism ‘power/knowledge’. The term power/knowledge demonstrates how, for Foucault, power and knowledge are inextricably linked. Foucault writes that ‘the exercise of power itself creates and causes to emerge new objects of knowledge and accumulates new bodies of information…[t]he exercise of power perpetually creates knowledge and, conversely, knowledge constantly induces effects of power’\xa0(1975, 52). Power and knowledge are not separate nor are they synonymous; instead, power both makes use of and shapes knowledge.\n\n'

His concepts, such as the Panopticon and docile bodies, remain highly relevant in today’s digital age, where surveillance and the collection of personal data are commonplace. By reflecting on how these ideas play out in our own lives, we can better understand the subtle ways we are shaped by society’s power structures and how we might resist them.\n\n'

The Shift from Public Punishment to Discipline\n\nFoucault begins by describing the violent, public spectacles of punishment that were common in the early modern period — executions, whippings, and torture served as both retribution and deterrent. These public punishments were intended to demonstrate the sovereign’s power over the body of the criminal. However, in the 18th century, there was a significant shift in how punishment was administered. Society moved away from punishing the body and toward disciplining the mind and soul. Prisons and other institutions like schools and hospitals became places where individuals were trained to self-regulate, making them easier to control.\n\n'

Written in 1975, it takes us on a journey through time, revealing the gradual shift from violent public spectacles of punishment to more subtle, internal forms of control. Foucault’s work isn’t just about prisons; it’s about how systems of power infiltrate every aspect of our lives — from education and health care to workplaces and the internet. His analysis speaks directly to the ways we are trained, observed, and ultimately controlled in modern society.\n\n'

Although some of Discipline and Punish\'s arguments allude to this process, Discipline and Punish is more explicitly concerned with what might be termed the “objectification” of individuals. See Gordon, Colin, The Birth of the Subject, in Radical Philosophy, No. 17 (Summer 1977). This later work also develops an important conception Foucault terms “bio-politics.” This refers to those strategies of government that concern themselves with the life, health, efficiency, and security of whole populations. Bio-political regulation is seen as a form of regulation that accompanies and complements the individually oriented “disciplines.”Google Scholar\n\n48\n\n'

The Power-Knowledge Nexus\n\nOne of Foucault’s central ideas is that power and knowledge are deeply intertwined. In Discipline and Punish, he shows how the rise of modern institutions like schools and prisons was accompanied by the rise of new forms of knowledge — particularly the human sciences like psychology and criminology. These forms of knowledge gave institutions the ability to observe, classify, and manage individuals. Foucault argues that by gathering knowledge about people, institutions could exert power over them more effectively. Those who hold knowledge — such as doctors, teachers, or psychologists — also hold power.\n\n'

The son of a prestigious surgeon, Foucault did not excel in school until enrolling in college, eventually earning admittance to one of France’s most prestigious universities, the École Normale Supérieure. There, Foucault earned degrees in both psychology and philosophy, but his academic success was not easily gained. Foucault suffered from horrible bouts of depression while enrolled at the École Normale, and he also failed his agrégation (a competitive exam for placement in the public education system) the first time around in 1950. Later, in 1958, while serving as a French delegate in Sweden, Foucault submitted his doctoral thesis at the University of Uppsala and had it rejected.\n\n'

His thesis on the history of the concept of “madness” (eventually accepted in France in 1961) was immediately well received, and Foucault continued to write influential books on some of the West’s most powerful social institutions, such as medicine, prisons, and religion, as well as groundbreaking works on more abstract theoretical issues of power, knowledge, sexuality, and selfhood. While the objects of Foucault’s studies seem to range widely, they all tend to focus on how knowledge of human beings is inextricably connected to power over them. For Foucault, the many modern concepts and practices that attempt to uncover “the truth” about human beings (either psychologically, sexually, or spiritually) actually create the very types of people they purport to discover.\n\n'

He accused Derrida’s obscurantist thoughts and writing and also disputed the idea that “there is nothing outside the text.” His project was particularly influenced by Nietzsche, his genealogy of knowledge\xa0being a direct allusion to Nietzsche’s genealogy of morals, and hence perhaps, he preferred being labeled as a “Nietzschean.”\nShare this:\n\n'

For Foucault, a discourse is an institutionalized way of speaking or writing about reality that defines what can be intelligibly thought and said about the world and what cannot. For example, in The History of Sexuality, Foucault argued that a new discourse of "sexuality" had fundamentally changed the way we think about desire, pleasure, and our innermost selves. In Foucault’s argument, discourses about sexuality did not discover some pre-existing, core truth about human identity, but rather created it through particular practices of power/knowledge (see next entry).\n\nPower/Knowledge\n\n'

According to Foucault, governmentality is the “art of governing,” not simply at the level of state politics, as we generally think of it, but the governing of a wide array of objects and persons such as entire populations at the most abstract level and one’s own desires and thoughts at a more micro level.\xa0 Foucault was especially interested in how, in contemporary times, the governing of conduct was increasingly focused on the management of populations. Unlike disciplinary power aimed at the training of individual bodies, the management of populations relied on biopower, understood as the policies and procedures that manage births, deaths, reproduction, and health and illness within the larger social body.\n\nWriting out Loud\n\nInteractive Reading\n\nHow Foucault Matters Today\n '

Power is not confined to governments or rulers; it is everywhere, embedded in the very fabric of society. This perspective has far-reaching implications:\n\nConclusion 🔗\n\nMichel Foucault’s genealogical writings provide a powerful lens to understand how power operates beyond the surface, shaping individuals and institutions in profound ways. By examining historical processes and everyday practices, Foucault uncovers the subtle, pervasive mechanisms of control that govern modern society. Works like Discipline and Punish offer invaluable insights into the dynamics of power-knowledge and its impact on the human body and identity.\n\nWhat do you think? How do you see power operating in your daily life? Can Foucault’s ideas help us rethink the way we engage with societal norms and institutions?\n\n'

He pursued his education at the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he studied philosophy and psychology. Foucault’s academic journey was marked by his deep engagement with the works of existentialists, structuralists, and historians of ideas, all of which shaped the trajectory of his intellectual development.\n\n'

Discourses, or systems of knowledge and language, establish what is considered valid or true, thereby enabling the exercise of power. Foucault’s genealogical method, as demonstrated in works like “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History”, traces the historical development of these discourses, uncovering their contingent and often arbitrary nature.\n\nFoucault’s later works focused on the concepts of subjectivity and ethics.\n\nHe examined how individuals are shaped by power and discourse but also how they can resist these forces through practices of the self. In his “History of Sexuality” series, particularly “The Use of Pleasure” and “The Care of the Self”, Foucault explored how ancient Greek and Roman philosophies provided models for ethical self-fashioning.\n\n'

Archaeology examines how discourses emerge and organize knowledge systems. While archaeology emphasizes the structural aspects of knowledge, genealogy shifts the focus to power and its role in shaping both knowledge and society.\n\nThe key distinction lies in their scope:\n\nThis methodological evolution allowed Foucault to move beyond a structural analysis of knowledge and into the dynamic, relational field of power, shedding light on how institutions like prisons, schools, and hospitals shape individuals.\n\nDisciplinary power: The making of the modern individual 🔗\n\n'

But what if power is more pervasive, intricate, and embedded in our everyday lives than we realize? Michel Foucault, the French philosopher, redefined our understanding of power through his groundbreaking concepts of discourse, archaeology, and genealogy. He delved into institutions like prisons and asylums to reveal how power operates subtly yet effectively, shaping societies and individuals alike.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUnraveling discourse: The power of words 🔗\n\nAt the heart of Foucault’s analysis is the concept of discourse. But what exactly is discourse? In simple terms, discourse refers to the ways in which knowledge and truth are constructed through language and practices. It’s more than just words; it’s the entire system of thoughts, beliefs, and norms that influence how we perceive and interact with the world.\n\nSource: https://systemicsustainability.wordpress.com/2025/01/07/michel-foucault-in-the-modern-context/\nTitle: Michel Foucault in the Modern Context – Systemic Sustainability\nContent: Instead, Foucault emphasized that power is also productive, shaping norms, identities, and desires ala Edward Bernays. His examination of sexuality challenged the idea that it had been suppressed in modern society, instead arguing that sexuality had become a central focus of scientific discourse and state intervention, and while this argument may be debated, it may also indicate that the modern disruption surrounding gender and sexuality is not necessarily a random, evolutionary process of societal norms.\n\nFoucault’s analysis of power-knowledge relationships is also a cornerstone of his work.\n\n'

This is especially relevant in modern society, which is increasingly shaped by centralized power structures, engineered narratives, and the interplay between subjective and objective truths.\n\nFoucault argued that power is not solely repressive but also productive, meaning it shapes identities, desires, and norms. This dual nature of power creates opportunities for resistance. Foucault’s concept of “practices of the self” refers to the ways individuals can cultivate ethical self-awareness and exercise agency within power structures through civic participation.\n\n'

Rather than assuming a linear progression or a singular truth, genealogy uncovers the messy, contingent, and often contradictory processes through which power operates. Drawing inspiration from Nietzsche’s concept of genealogy, Foucault emphasizes that history is not a march toward progress but a battlefield where power struggles and conflicting forces shape societal norms.\n\nFor Foucault, genealogy is about understanding “how” power works rather than “why.” It examines the emergence of societal norms, institutions, and practices to reveal the hidden mechanisms of control. This method rejects grand narratives, focusing instead on localized and contextual histories to demonstrate how power is dispersed and embedded in the fabric of everyday life.\n\n'

        'Source: https://genealogiesofmodernity.org/journal/2021/6/8/what-foucault-meant\nTitle: Genealogies of Modernity — What Foucault Meant When He Said “Genealogy”\nContent: In stressing possibility, I am emphasizing an underdeveloped dimension of Foucault’s analysis of pouvoir, or power, as it usually appears in English translations of his work. As Philipp Rosemann reminded me, pouvoir has more semantic overlap with the Latin virtus than it does with the English power. Less a force against an object, or force made structure, as Derrida once defined it, Foucault’s pouvoir is capacity or capability to do something; pouvoir is capability made possible by contingency.\n\nIt is common to describe Foucault’s genealogy as a campaign dedicated to unmasking the will to power by revealing institutions’ bad-faith assertions of noble origins. My charitable reading suggests another aspect of genealogy, a hermeneutic of historical contingency oriented to limit cases when new capabilities can emerge through different relations within and among institutions, communities, and individuals. This Foucault is not only critical but also constructive, creative.\n '

With genealogy, Foucault set out to unearth the artificiality of the dividing line between the putatively illegitimate and its putatively normal and natural opposite. Discipline and Punish was his genealogical exposé of the artifices of power-knowledge that had resulted in the naturalization of the “criminal character,” and the first volume of Histoire de la sexualité (1976; The History of Sexuality) was his exposé of the Frankensteinian machinations that had resulted in the naturalization of the dividing line between the “homosexual” and the “heterosexual.” Yet even in these luminous “histories of the present” something still remained out of view: human freedom.

He has galvanized an army of detractors, the less attentive of whom have misread his critique of “man” as radically antihumanist, his critique of power-knowledge as radically relativist, and his ethics as radically aestheticist. They have not, however, prevented him from inspiring increasingly important alternatives to established practices of cultural and intellectual history. In France and the Americas, Foucault’s unraveling of Marxist universalism has continued both to vex and to inspire activists of the left. The antipsychiatry movement of the 1970s and ’80s owed much to Foucault, though he did not consider himself one of its members. His critique of the human sciences provoked much soul-searching within anthropology and its allied fields, even as it helped a new generation of scholars to embark upon a cross-cultural dialogue on the themes and variations of domination and subjectivation.

Key phrases and concepts drawn from Foucault’s historical work now form part of the everyday language of criticism and analysis. Foucault’s texts continue to resonate with contemporary readers, and this resonance can be misunderstood in a chronological survey of his key ideas and works, since the man who rejected notions of historical progress – preferring to work with the notion of what he called the epistemic break – produced works that cannot be neatly fitted into a condensed and orderly summary that appears to move smoothly from one text to another. In other words, it is important when reading any summary of Foucault’s life and work, to think of his theories as forming a critical constellation, rather than a developmental, logical system.

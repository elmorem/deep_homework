He is remembered for his method of using historical research to illuminate changes in discourse over time, and the evolving relationships between discourse, knowledge, institutions, and power. Foucault\u2019s work inspired sociologists in subfields including sociology of knowledge; gender, sexuality and queer theory; critical theory;\u00a0\u00a0deviance and crime; and the sociology of education. His most well-known works include Discipline and Punish, The History of Sexuality, and The Archaeology of Knowledge.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\nContent: Michel Foucault\n\nMichel Foucault, born as Paul-Michel Foucault on October 15, 1926, in Poitiers, France, was a French philosopher, historian of ideas, writer, political activist, and literary critic[1\u2020][2\u2020]. He is recognized as one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period[1\u2020]. His theories primarily address the relationships between power and knowledge, and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions[1\u2020][2\u2020].\n\nSource: https://www.thoughtco.com/michel-foucault-biography-3026478\nTitle: Michel Foucault Biography and Intellectual History\nContent: Intellectual Legacy\n\nFoucault's key intellectual contribution was\u00a0his deft ability to illustrate that institutions--like science, medicine, and the penal system--through the use of discourse, create subject categories for people to inhabit, and turn people into objects of scrutiny and of knowledge. Thus, he argued, those who control institutions and their discourses wield power in society, because they shape the trajectories and outcomes of people's lives.\n\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\nContent: Conclusion and Legacy\n\nMichel Foucault\u2019s legacy is vast and influential, extending across various fields of study, including sociology, philosophy, and critical theory. His work has resonated in the field of security studies, foregrounding the biopolitical imperative at the heart of liberal governance[11\u2020]. His ideas have been instrumental in understanding how institutions, through the use of discourse, create subject categories for people to inhabit, turning people into objects of scrutiny and knowledge[4\u2020].\n\nFoucault\u2019s key intellectual contribution was his ability to illustrate that institutions like science, medicine, and the penal system, through the use of discourse, create subject categories for people to inhabit, and turn people into objects of scrutiny and knowledge[4\u2020].

Despite the critiques, Foucault\u2019s theories continue to provide inspiration, concepts, and analytical frameworks for scholars in various fields[7\u2020][8\u2020].\n\nFoucault\u2019s work has also been applied to education policy analysis, exploring the \u2018hows\u2019 and \u2018whos\u2019 of education policy, its technologies, and its subjectivities[7\u2020][9\u2020].\n\nOverall, Michel Foucault\u2019s work has been both influential and controversial, sparking extensive analysis, evaluation, and ongoing debate in the academic community[7\u2020][8\u2020][9\u2020].\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMichel Foucault was known to be a complex and many-sided character[2\u2020].

He has had strong influence not only in philosophy but also in a wide range of humanistic and social scientific disciplines.\n\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\nContent: Analysis and Evaluation\n\nMichel Foucault\u2019s work has been the subject of extensive analysis and evaluation. His theories on power, knowledge, and discourse have significantly influenced a wide range of academic disciplines[7\u2020][8\u2020].\n\nFoucault\u2019s concept of \u2018discursive practice\u2019 has been applied to fields such as educational evaluation[7\u2020]. His perspective suggests that evaluation technologies can be seen as an expression of \u2018the will to power\u2019, leading to a critical examination of these technologies[7\u2020].\n\nIn his Archaeological and Genealogical periods, Foucault developed his conceptions of discourse[7\u2020][8\u2020]. His Archaeological conceptions focused on the discourse-subject relationship and the rules of discursive formations[7\u2020][8\u2020]. During his Genealogical period, Foucault shifted his focus to power, viewing discourse as a manifestation of the will to power[7\u2020][8\u2020].\n\nSource: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault | French Philosopher, Historian & Social Theorist | Britannica\nContent: Why is Michel Foucault important?\nMichel Foucault was one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period. The first volume of\u00a0his work The History of Sexuality\u00a0became\u00a0canonical\u00a0for gay and lesbian\u00a0studies and queer theory. Through his work, the terms\u00a0discourse,\u00a0genealogy, and\u00a0power-knowledge\u00a0became entrenched in contemporary social and cultural research.\n\nWhere was Michel Foucault educated?\nA distinguished but sometimes erratic student, Michel Foucault gained entry at the age of 20 to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) in\u00a0Paris\u00a0in 1946. There he studied psychology and\u00a0philosophy, embraced and then abandoned\u00a0communism, and established a reputation as a sedulous, brilliant, and\u00a0eccentric\u00a0student.\n\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\nContent: Foucault, who refused to be put into any one category, maintained that \u201cThe main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not at the beginning.\u201d[12\u2020] This quote encapsulates the essence of Foucault\u2019s philosophy and his approach to understanding power, knowledge, and the self[12\u2020].\n\nUndeniably one of the most influential intellectuals of his time, Foucault\u2019s work continues to be studied and referenced, and his ideas continue to shape critical thought and our understanding of power, knowledge, and institutions[11\u2020][4\u2020][12\u2020].\n\nKey Information\n\nReferences and Citations:\n\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\nContent: Foucault was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV, at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, and at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology[1\u2020][2\u2020]. His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in communication studies, anthropology, psychology, sociology, criminology, cultural studies, literary theory, feminism, Marxism, and critical theory[1\u2020][2\u2020].\n\nEarly Years and Education\n\nMichel Foucault was born on October 15, 1926, in Poitiers, France, into an upper-middle-class family[1\u2020][2\u2020]. His father, Paul Foucault, was an eminent surgeon who hoped his son would join him in the profession[1\u2020][3\u2020]. However, Foucault resisted what he regarded as the provincialism of his upbringing and his native country[1\u2020].\n Source: https://sserr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sserr-11-1-41-51.pdf\nTitle: 11.1\nContent: highlights the crucial significance of Foucault's theories as a theoretical framework for understanding the \nintricacies of higher education, where academic institutions are acknowledged as centres of power dynamics and \nthe creation of knowledge. The article examines the use of Foucault's power and knowledge framework in higher \neducation research while also recognising its influence. The text explores the difficulties, inconsistencies, and \npossible restrictions while also discussing worries regarding the freedom of academia, opposition from established \nauthorities, and the risk of knowledge becoming too uniform within specific fields. The critique encompasses the \nmarginalised voices in academia, raising doubts about the efficacy of the framework in enhancing the visibility of \nthese perspectives.

It is possible to critically examine Foucault's \ntheories, despite the fact that they provide a strong foundation for comprehending the intricacies of knowledge \nformation. Investigating Foucault's power/knowledge paradigm within the framework of research on higher \neducation, this article sets out on an extensive examination.

While Foucault contends that there is no center of power, his account of power remains top-down or structural, missing the interactive and enabling aspects of power. A more balanced view would suggest that all exercises of power include meaningful agency (the ability to do something); social structures (not simply as constraints but as interactive creations); social knowledge (including both reifying truth claims and enabling truth or knowledge); and social-ontological being-in-the-social-world (both as enabling and dominating).\nKeywords:\n\nFoucault\nagency\ndomination\npower\nstructure\n\nSource: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\nTitle: Just a moment...\nContent: Foucault writes as if no one since the likes of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Nietzsche had written about power. But even after Weber, contemporaries of Foucault were conducting debates about the subject. There was the three-dimensional power debate, which ran from Robert Dahl (Citation1957) to Peter Bachrach and Morton S. Baratz (1962) to Steven Lukes (Citation1974). There was also the consensual power tradition, which argued, as Foucault did, that power is positive, not simply interdictive. The most well-known exemplar at that time was Talcott Parsons\u2019 Citation1963 essay \u201cOn the Concept of Political Power\u201d and Hannah Arendt\u2019s short book On Violence (Citation1970). Thus, while Foucault takes a sociological approach to power, knowledge, and subject formation, conventional sociological theory is absent, including the work of others, many of whom made similar arguments.\n\nSource: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\nTitle: Just a moment...\nContent: Foucault and the Power of Agency\nPeter Digeser (1994) was the first theorist to add Foucault, as a fourth dimension, to the three-dimensional power debate. But we can, in addition, re-theorize the first three faces in a manner that focuses on the concepts of agency and structure in sociological theory. In brief, the first face of power corresponds to agency, as power-to and power-over; the second face corresponds to social structure; the third face to social knowledge or the epistemic underpinnings of social action; and the fourth face to social ontology, or the being-in-the-world of social subjects. As these phenomena constitute parts of all social interaction, the four faces of power should not be considered separate phenomena but different aspects of social interaction. They are like the four dimensions of an architect\u2019s plan, which exist conjointly. I will go through each of the four faces or dimensions of power with a special emphasis upon the relevance to Foucault.Footnote1\n Source: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-bar-foundation-research-journal/article/abs/foucaults-discipline-and-punish-an-exposition-and-critique/D06D179F726FADC025C451C6D51B64B8\nTitle: Foucault's Discipline and Punish An Exposition and Critique | American Bar Foundation Research Journal | Cambridge Core\nContent: We use cookies to distinguish you from other users and to provide you with a better experience on our websites.

Foucault initially wanted to provide a power of speech for those confined to a discourse. This includes those who do not have the knowledge required to accumulate power.\n\nI feel that their issues have been brought to light, however the reasons exceeding this is for the purpose of gaining insight into the functioning of society in sociological terms. This does not give attention to their possibly ambiguous labelling of being \u201cabnormal\u201d. They have purely become a vessel to greater knowledge. Foucault rejected norms as positive determinants. It was seen by him as negative and oppressive. The unusual phenomenon is not a natural process instinctually followed by humans. Foucault strived to highlight this irregularity through his book.\n\nSource: https://phdessay.com/focault-discipline-and-punish/\nTitle: Focault- Discipline and Punish - PHDessay.com\nContent: Focault- Discipline and Punish\n\nIntroduction:\n\n\u041c. Foucault. 1975. Discipline and Punish: The birth of the prison. New York: Random House Inc. Below is an in depth book review of Discipline and Punish, The Birth of the Prison. The author who compiled the analysis on this is Michel Foucault, whom provided enlightenment on many different aspects of sociology and philosophy- many which are still immensely relevant to societies today.\n\nI will be using this book review to channel an outline of Foucault\u2019s work, viewpoints and purposes as such. Along with this I will include my personal critique of my literary experience of the book. I will consider important factors of logic, coherence, evidence, expertise and originality. These specified fields are all crucial to useful and meaningful sociological theories. In brief, my aim is to clarify the argument presented by Foucault and provide my account of its validity.\n\nSource: https://phdessay.com/focault-discipline-and-punish/\nTitle: Focault- Discipline and Punish - PHDessay.com\nContent: My reaction or evaluation will conclude that Foucault has cleverly addressed establishments in sociology whilst using the penal system as a commonality to provide a practical sample- which in turn favours the readers understanding of sociology in general. The audience for this theoretical work is most likely to target scholars of human sciences and philosophy. It may also spark interests of inquiries into the classical period given its historical flair.\n\nMain arguments of Discipline and Punish:\n\nPower: Foucault uses power as a central point of reference for punishing.\n\nSource: https://phdessay.com/focault-discipline-and-punish/\nTitle: Focault- Discipline and Punish - PHDessay.com\nContent: He had extensive training and experience in human sciences, from which he created his career. His direct encounters with the penal systems and prisons also granted him access to knowledge not readily available to others- thus making his expertise relative to the issue at hand. Keeping the short-comings I have mentioned in mind, I feel that Foucault\u2019s arguments are valid and they all have been researched to the point where its concrete significance cannot be denied. Their continued relevance over the years supports my conclusion and it has in general been presented in a clear and concise manner.\n\nCite this Page\n\nFocault- Discipline and Punish.

Although some of Discipline and Punish's arguments allude to this process, Discipline and Punish is more explicitly concerned with what might be termed the \u201cobjectification\u201d of individuals. See Gordon, Colin, The Birth of the Subject, in Radical Philosophy, No. 17 (Summer 1977). This later work also develops an important conception Foucault terms \u201cbio-politics.\u201d This refers to those strategies of government that concern themselves with the life, health, efficiency, and security of whole populations. Bio-political regulation is seen as a form of regulation that accompanies and complements the individually oriented \u201cdisciplines.\u201dGoogle Scholar\n\n48\n\nSource: https://phdessay.com/focault-discipline-and-punish/\nTitle: Focault- Discipline and Punish - PHDessay.com\nContent: The evidence Foucault uses to elaborate his views and arguments are sufficient to enhance the validity of his study and specific arguments. He often provides actual occurrences in history- much like his introduction reporting on Damien\u2019s execution in 1757 and referring to the opening of Mettray prison colony. Extensive referencing has been made available allowing further validation of facts. This in turn contributes to his ability to convince and persuade. Michel Foucault most definitely possessed the right attributes and expertise to work on this research problem.\n\nSource: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-bar-foundation-research-journal/article/abs/foucaults-discipline-and-punish-an-exposition-and-critique/D06D179F726FADC025C451C6D51B64B8\nTitle: Foucault's Discipline and Punish An Exposition and Critique | American Bar Foundation Research Journal | Cambridge Core\nContent: 7\nMuch of Foucault's work is concerned to analyze the human sciences (or \u201cthe sciences of man\u201d) and their effects on modern forms of government and regulation. The Order of Things, supra note 1, develops an analysis of the discursive conditions on which the human sciences depend.

His work, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, is not just about prisons but about how power operates in various systems, including schools, workplaces, hospitals, and even everyday life. He argued that modern societies have developed sophisticated ways to discipline people without the need for overt violence or brutality.

Consistent with much postmodern thoughts, Foucault affirmed the impossibility of escaping the shackles of some form of power or the other and that power is a constitutive dimension of all discourse. He posits the idea of the all seeing \u2014 panoptic \u2014 surveillance State (corresponding to Jeremy Bentham\u2018s panopticon prison), that exerts power through discursive practices, circulating ideology through the body\u00a0politic, and through subtle, indirect oppression.\nThe panoptic state is seen as a monolithic structure, where change is nearly impossible, where power is ubiquitous and exists in capillary forms.\n\nSource: https://literariness.org/2016/04/04/foucaults-influence-on-postmodern-thought/\nTitle: Foucault\u2019s Influence on Postmodern Thought \u2013 Literary Theory and Criticism \nContent: Facebook\nWhatsApp\nTwitter\nEmail\nPocket\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nTumblr\nPinterest\nTelegram\n\nMore\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\n\n\u2039 Frankfurt School\u2019s Contribution to Postmodern Thought\nFoucault\u2019s Concept of Power \u203a\n\nCategories: Philosophy\nTags: 1984, BIG BROTHER.

His primary attempt was to unravel the underlying structures of thinking in the various fields of knowledge because he considered these structures as conditioned and constructed. Knowledge is constructed, organised, shared and used through particular forms of speech/writing and language called \u201cDiscourse,\u201d which refers to the context in which meaning is produced. Through his works Madness and Civilization, The Birth of the Clinic, Discipline and Punish, where he studies the \u201cconstruction\u201d of the insane, the sick and the criminal respectively, he demonstrates how discourses condition people\u2019s lives and inform their thinking, and how they construct and legitimise unequal power relations.\n Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Wikipedia\nContent: Jump to content\nMain menu\nSearch\nDonate\nCreate account\nLog in\nPersonal tools\nToggle the table of contents\nMichel Foucault\n90 languages\nArticle\nTalk\nRead\nView source\nView history\nTools\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\"Foucault\" redirects here.

Foucault's theories primarily addressed the relationships between power versus knowledge and liberty, and he analyzed how they are used as a form of social control through multiple institutions. Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels and sought to critique authority without limits on himself.[10] His thought has influenced academics within a large number of contrasting areas of study, with this especially including those working in anthropology, communication studies, criminology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, psychology, and sociology.

With genealogy, Foucault set out to unearth the artificiality of the dividing line between the putatively illegitimate and its putatively normal and natural opposite. Discipline and Punish was his genealogical expos\u00e9 of the artifices of power-knowledge that had resulted in the naturalization of the \u201ccriminal character,\u201d and the first volume of Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9 (1976; The History of Sexuality) was his expos\u00e9 of the Frankensteinian machinations that had resulted in the naturalization of the dividing line between the \u201chomosexual\u201d and the \u201cheterosexual.\u201d Yet even in these luminous \u201chistories of the present\u201d something still remained out of view: human freedom. In order to bring it into focus, Foucault turned\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Wikipedia\nContent: ^ Foucault, Michel (1982).

Foucault subsequently published The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the Coll\u00e8ge de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in several left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and other violations of human rights, focusing on struggles such as penal reform. Foucault later published Discipline and Punish (1975) and The History of Sexuality (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods that emphasized the role that power plays in society.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Wikipedia\nContent: Philosophical work\nSee also: Michel Foucault bibliography\nFoucault's colleague Pierre Bourdieu summarized the philosopher's thought as \"a long exploration of transgression, of going beyond social limits, always inseparably linked to knowledge and power\".[187]\nThe theme that underlies all Foucault's work is the relationship between power and knowledge, and how the former is used to control and define the latter. What authorities claim as 'scientific knowledge' are really just means of social control. Foucault shows how, for instance, in the eighteenth century 'madness' was used to categorize and stigmatize not just the mentally ill but the poor, the sick, the homeless and, indeed, anyone whose expressions of individuality were unwelcome.\n\u2014\u200aPhilip Stokes, Philosophy: 100 Essential Thinkers (2004)[188]\n",

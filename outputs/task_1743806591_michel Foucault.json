Foucault's theories primarily addressed the relationships between power versus knowledge and liberty, and he analyzed how they are used as a form of social control through multiple institutions. Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels and sought to critique authority without limits on himself.[10] His thought has influenced academics within a large number of contrasting areas of study, with this especially including those working in anthropology, communication studies, criminology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, psychology, and sociology.

A persistent theme in Foucault\u2019s work is the relationship between power and knowledge, culminating in his neologism \u2018power/knowledge\u2019. The term power/knowledge demonstrates how, for Foucault, power and knowledge are inextricably linked. Foucault writes that \u2018the exercise of power itself creates and causes to emerge new objects of knowledge and accumulates new bodies of information\u2026[t]he exercise of power perpetually creates knowledge and, conversely, knowledge constantly induces effects of power\u2019\u00a0(1975, 52).

Michel Foucault's genealogical method, which serves as Koopman's paradigm case of genealogy, is enormously influential but often misunderstood by critics and fans alike. Koopman's defense of genealogy rests on a two-step revision of our understanding of Foucault's method: first, Koopman rethinks the relationship between Foucaultian genealogy and Kantian critique; second, he interprets Foucault's practice of Kantian critique through the lens of problematization. Once we reinterpret Foucaultian genealogy along these lines, Koopman argues, we will be able to see that his work belongs in conversation with that of critical theorists such as Habermas and pragmatists such as Dewey and Rorty, rather than with the Continental high theorists -- Derrida, Lacan,\n\nSource: https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/genealogy-as-critique-foucault-and-the-problems-of-modernity/\nTitle: Genealogy as Critique: Foucault and the Problems of Modernity | Reviews | Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews | University of Notre Dame\nContent: These questions are not meant to challenge Koopman's claim that Foucaultian genealogy can and should be reconciled with Habermasian critical theory, but only to suggest that such a project may not be quite as philosophically modest as Koopman claims that it is. Moreover, if Koopman hasn't given fully satisfactory answers to these questions here, this does not in any way detract from the significant achievement that this book represents.\u00a0Genealogy as Critique\u00a0breathes fresh air into a number of stale scholarly debates about the periodization of Foucault's work, the viability of genealogy as a method, and the relationship between Foucault and his interlocutors.

Koopman's main aim here is to distinguish Foucault's problematizing genealogical method from the subversive and vindicatory versions of genealogy offered by Nietzsche and Bernard Williams, respectively; he also argues that this characterization of Foucaultian genealogy shows why the genetic fallacy objection, often raised against Foucault, misses the mark. What distinguishes Foucault's problematizing genealogy from Nietzsche's and Williams's more normatively ambitious versions is that whereas they used genealogy to generate normative justifications -- Williams used it to vindicate our concept of truthfulness whereas Nietzsche used it to undermine Christian morality -- Foucault used it for the normatively modest task of clarifying and intensifying our problematizations.

First, when Foucault says \u201cgenealogy,\u201d he does not mean the natural sciences\u2019 method of studying heritability. And he is more interested in the aristocratic, rather than the bourgeois approach, to heredity. This first observation affords a second: Foucault contrasts the science of genetics to aristocratic genealogy. And he adopts the aristocratic version of genealogy\u2014concerned with sanguinity for political purposes\u2014as the model for his analogical use of the term to name his own historical method. When Foucault says \u201cgenealogy,\u201d he is thinking of aristocratic genealogy.\n\nThese observations enable us to parse this mature statement of Foucault\u2019s genealogical method:\n\nSource: https://genealogiesofmodernity.org/journal/2021/6/8/what-foucault-meant\nTitle: Genealogies of Modernity \u2014 What Foucault Meant When He Said \u201cGenealogy\u201d\nContent: In this 1978 lecture he gave at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Foucault speaks of \u201cgenetics\u201d to indicate the natural sciences\u2019 method of studying heritability. He contrasts his genealogical method to any evolutionary model of history. His genealogy is not interested in heredity except insofar as a hermeneutics of heredity expresses political opportunity.

Chapter five focuses on Foucault's problematization of modernity. Koopman argues that this critique has often been interpreted in terms of a Weberian logic of exclusion and domination, according to which \"reason dominates madness by totally excluding it, and . . . power dominates freedom by totally incorporating it\" (163), whereas Foucault endeavored to make the rather different point that modernity operates according to a futile logic of purification, according to which reason is purified of madness and freedom of power. For Koopman's Foucault, this logic is futile because reason/madness and power/freedom presuppose one another in modernity; they are, in other words, \"reciprocal and incompatible\" (163). Hence, the proper response to Foucault's critique is not the liberation of madness or freedom but rather a\n\nSource: https://genealogiesofmodernity.org/journal/2021/6/8/what-foucault-meant\nTitle: Genealogies of Modernity \u2014 What Foucault Meant When He Said \u201cGenealogy\u201d\nContent: What Foucault Meant When He Said \u201cGenealogy\u201d\n\nWhen Michel Foucault was up for a coveted job at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1969, he proposed to teach a course on the history of the science of heritability, \u201cstarting from breeding techniques, on through attempts to improve species, experiments with intensive cultivation, efforts to combat animal and plant epidemics, and culminating in the establishment of a genetics whose birth date can be placed at the beginning of the twentieth century.\u201d He did get the job, and although the course never came about, research for it made its way into the first volume of The History of Sexuality.\n\nThere Foucault observes the contrast between two models of heredity in the nineteenth century: aristocratic genealogy that tracked bloodlines and bourgeois genealogy that attended to the health and vitality of the body.\n\nSource: https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/genealogy-as-critique-foucault-and-the-problems-of-modernity/\nTitle: Genealogy as Critique: Foucault and the Problems of Modernity | Reviews | Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews | University of Notre Dame\nContent: wasn't trying to draw any normative conclusions from his genealogical arguments, then he can hardly be guilty of inappropriately drawing normative conclusions about some present concept or practice on the basis of an analysis of its history, as the genetic fallacy charge alleges. Foucault's genealogies do provide resources for normative critique, on Koopman's view, but his genealogies by themselves are not meant to be tools of normative assessment. Koopman thinks this also shows why Foucault's version of genealogy is superior to Nietzsche's and Williams's, since both Nietzsche and Williams try to get more from genealogy than it can possibly give.\n\nSource: https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/genealogy-as-critique-foucault-and-the-problems-of-modernity/\nTitle: Genealogy as Critique: Foucault and the Problems of Modernity | Reviews | Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews | University of Notre Dame\nContent: The book divides into roughly three, not entirely equal, parts. After an introductory chapter that situates Koopman's view within existing Foucault scholarship, the first four chapters explicate the method of genealogical problematization, understood as a transformative renewal of the Kantian notion of critique. The next two chapters re-read Foucault's work in light of the account of his method offered in the first half of the book. The concluding chapter makes the case for the methodological reconciliation of Foucaultian genealogy as problematization and pragmatist critical theory. The book as a whole is guided by Koopman's understanding of philosophy as a critical enterprise, \"an immanent and reflexive engagement with the full complexity and contingency of the conditions of possibility for doing, being, and thinking in our cultural present\" (23).\n Source: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault/Foucaults-ideas\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Philosopher, Postmodernism, Power | Britannica\nContent: Table of Contents\nTable of Contents Ask the Chatbot\nQuick Facts\nIn full:\nPaul-Michel Foucault\n(Show\u00a0more)\nBorn:\nOctober 15, 1926, Poitiers, France\n(Show\u00a0more)\nDied:\nJune 25, 1984, Paris (aged 57)\n(Show\u00a0more)\nSubjects Of Study:\nmental disorder\nprison\nsexuality\nsociety\n(Show\u00a0more)\nOn the Web:\nBBC Sounds - Thinking Allowed - Michel Foucault - a special programme on his work and influence.

He has galvanized an army of detractors, the less attentive of whom have misread his critique of \u201cman\u201d as radically antihumanist, his critique of power-knowledge as radically relativist, and his ethics as radically aestheticist. They have not, however, prevented him from inspiring increasingly important alternatives to established practices of cultural and intellectual history. In France and the Americas, Foucault\u2019s unraveling of Marxist universalism has continued both to vex and to inspire activists of the left. The antipsychiatry movement of the 1970s and \u201980s owed much to Foucault, though he did not consider himself one of its members. His critique of the human sciences provoked much soul-searching within anthropology and its allied fields, even as it helped a new generation of scholars to embark upon a cross-cultural dialogue on the themes and variations of domination and subjectivation.

Key phrases and concepts drawn from Foucault\u2019s historical work now form part of the everyday language of criticism and analysis. Foucault\u2019s texts continue to resonate with contemporary readers, and this resonance can be misunderstood in a chronological survey of his key ideas and works, since the man who rejected notions of historical progress \u2013 preferring to work with the notion of what he called the epistemic break \u2013 produced works that cannot be neatly fitted into a condensed and orderly summary that appears to move smoothly from one text to another. In other words, it is important when reading any summary of Foucault\u2019s life and work, to think of his theories as forming a critical constellation, rather than a developmental, logical system. Born in Poitiers, France, Foucault studied at school with the great commentator on Hegel,\n\nSource: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault/Foucaults-ideas\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Philosopher, Postmodernism, Power | Britannica\nContent: Michel Foucault - Philosopher, Postmodernism, Power | Britannica\n\nSearch Britannica  Click here to search\n\nSearch Britannica  Click here to search\nSUBSCRIBE\nSUBSCRIBE\nLogin\nhttps://premium.britannica.com/premium-membership/?utm_source=premium&utm_medium=nav-login-box&utm_campaign=evergreen\nSUBSCRIBE\nAsk the ChatbotGames & QuizzesHistory & SocietyScience & TechBiographiesAnimals & NatureGeography & TravelArts & CultureProConMoneyVideos\nMichel Foucault\nTable of Contents\n\n\nIntroduction & Top Questions\n\n\nEducation and career\n\n\nFoucault\u2019s ideas\n\n\nFoucault\u2019s influence\n\n\nReferences & Edit History Quick Facts & Related Topics\nImages\n\nFor Students\n\nMichel Foucault summary\nQuizzes\n\nPhilosophy 101\nRelated Questions\n\nWhy is Michel Foucault important?\nWhat did Michel Foucault write?\nWhat was Michel Foucault\u2019s occupation?\nWhat is the weather like in Paris?\nWhat is the landscape of Paris?\n\nRead Next\n\n5 Common Misconceptions About Schizophrenia\n\nPhilosophers to Know, Part I\n\nSource: https://literariness.org/2017/03/28/key-theories-of-michel-foucault/\nTitle: Key Theories of Michel Foucault \u2013 Literary Theory and Criticism \nContent: believe themselves to be under total surveillance, functions as a metaphor explaining how and why subjects thereby modify their own behaviour. Applied to countless literary texts, the panopticon lives on in myriad\u00a0\u00a0works of literary theory. Self-regulation is explored from another perspective in Foucault\u2019s final works, a series of studies called A History of Sexuality. In many respects, this apparent shift of focus, from disciplinary discourses and institutions that have radically transformed and reinvented themselves, to that of the body and sexualities, may indeed be the major continuity in Foucault\u2019s work, since bodily regimes have always been a subtext, be they overt or covert, textual or autobiographical, in his approach; Foucault\u2019s impact remains high as the contemporary humanities follows the trajectories of his thought, and the discontinuous, but traceable, contours of his map of knowledge production and being.\n\nSource: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault/Foucaults-ideas\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Philosopher, Postmodernism, Power | Britannica\nContent: Foucault appropriately placed himself in the critical tradition of philosophical inquiry stemming from Kant, but his thought matured through the multiplicity of its engagements. He rejected both Hegelianism and Marxism but took both quite seriously. The work of the French modernist writers Raymond Roussel, Georges Bataille, and Maurice Blanchot galvanized his conviction that neither a proper epistemology nor a proper metaphysics could be founded on a general and ahistorical conception of the \u201csubject.\u201d The writings of Friedrich Nietzsche directed him to the history of the body and of the collusion between power and knowledge. It also offered him the prototypes for both archaeology and genealogy. In the work of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze he discerned elements of a general epistemology of problem formation. His conversations with the American scholars Hubert Dreyfus and Paul Rabinow stimulated his turn toward ethics and the genealogy of problematization. Special mention must\n\nSource: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault/Foucaults-ideas\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Philosopher, Postmodernism, Power | Britannica\nContent: Foucault has attracted several biographers, some of whom have been happy to flout his opposition to the practice of seeking the key to an oeuvre in the psychology or personality of its author. Yet, in their favour, it must be admitted that Foucault\u2019s personal life is a worthy subject of attention. He regularly made the issues that most troubled him personally\u2014emotional suffering, exclusion, sexuality\u2014the topics of his research. His critiques were often both theoretical and practical; he did not merely write about prisons, for example, but also organized protests against them. In 1975, while in Spain to protest the impending executions of two members of ETA, the Basque separatist movement, by the government of Francisco Franco, Foucault confronted police officers who had come to seize the protest leaflets he had prepared. He also publicly attacked Jean-Paul Sartre at a time when Sartre was still the demigod of Parisian intellectuals.\n\nSource: https://literariness.org/2017/03/28/key-theories-of-michel-foucault/\nTitle: Key Theories of Michel Foucault \u2013 Literary Theory and Criticism \nContent: While all of Foucault\u2019s texts rapidly impacted upon the worlds of literary theory and other methodologies within the humanities \u2013 especially once he started to visit the US in the early 1970s \u2013 it is perhaps his Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison (1975), translated in 1977 as Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, that has continued to inspire literary critics. This is not so much for the subject matter of the book, but for the metaphor of internalized surveillance, embodied most memorably in Jeremy Bentham\u2019s prison design called the panopticon. Foucault\u2019s concept of the \u2018microphysics of power\u2019 suggests that modern disciplinary methods are internalized and produce subjects that are constituted via a network of relations. The traditional \u2018top down\u2019 notion of power is thus replaced with one that is horizontal, not vertical. The panopticon, a prison where the prisoners believe themselves to be under total surveillance, functions as a metaphor explaining how and why\n\"\n    ---\n    Using the above information, answer the following query or task: \"michel Foucault\" in a summary report --\n    The report should focus on the answer to the query, should be well structured, informative, \n    and comprehensive, with facts and numbers if available.

# Michel Foucault: Power, Knowledge, and the Making of Modern Thought

## Introduction

Michel Foucault (1926–1984) remains one of the most influential and controversial intellectuals of the 20th century, whose work continues to shape contemporary thought across a wide range of disciplines, including philosophy, sociology, history, cultural studies, and gender studies. Born in Poitiers, France, Foucault's academic journey began at the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he studied psychology and philosophy. His early intellectual pursuits were marked by a rejection of traditional historical narratives and a commitment to exploring the intersections of power, knowledge, and subjectivity ([Budding Sociologist](https://buddingsociologist.in/michel-foucault/); [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault)).

Foucault is best known for his groundbreaking theories on the relationship between power and knowledge, encapsulated in his concept of "power/knowledge." This idea posits that power and knowledge are not separate entities but are deeply intertwined, with power shaping what is considered knowledge and knowledge reinforcing power structures. As Foucault famously wrote, "the exercise of power perpetually creates knowledge and, conversely, knowledge constantly induces effects of power" ([Perlego](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)). His work challenged conventional understandings of authority, truth, and societal norms, offering a radical critique of modern institutions such as prisons, hospitals, and schools, which he argued function as mechanisms of social control ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/)).

Foucault's intellectual contributions are diverse and multifaceted, spanning historical inquiries into madness, medical practices, and punishment, as well as analyses of sexuality and identity. His major works, including *Madness and Civilization* (1961), *Discipline and Punish* (1975), and *The History of Sexuality* (1976), exemplify his innovative methodologies, such as archaeology and genealogy, which emphasize discontinuities and ruptures in historical narratives ([Global Journals](https://globaljournals.org/GJHSS_Volume21/2-Foucaults-Concept-of-History.pdf); [Literariness](https://literariness.org/2017/03/28/key-theories-of-michel-foucault/)).

Foucault's legacy is both celebrated and critiqued. While his ideas have profoundly influenced post-structuralist and postmodern thought, they have also sparked debates regarding their perceived relativism, antihumanism, and lack of normative grounding. Critics such as Jürgen Habermas and Nancy Fraser have questioned the implications of Foucault's theories for ethics and political resistance, while others have highlighted the challenges of applying his concepts to contemporary issues ([Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-intellectual-history/article/foucault-poststructuralism-and-the-fixed-openness-of-history/EC9D3735BB7929416001A670E8C8601D); [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault)).

Despite these critiques, Foucault's work continues to inspire scholars and practitioners across disciplines. His exploration of power, knowledge, and subjectivity has provided a critical framework for analyzing modern society, making him an enduring figure in the intellectual landscape of the 21st century ([Sociologija](https://www.sociologija.org/admin/published/2024_66/4/871.pdf); [Budding Sociologist](https://buddingsociologist.in/michel-foucault/)).

## Foucault's Theory of Power and Knowledge  

### The Interrelation of Power and Knowledge  

Michel Foucault's concept of power/knowledge reveals the inseparability of power and knowledge, emphasizing that they do not exist as independent entities but are mutually constitutive. Foucault argues that power generates knowledge and, conversely, knowledge reinforces power. This dynamic is not merely hierarchical but circulates throughout society, shaping what is considered truth and who has the authority to define it ([source](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)).  

While traditional theories of power often focus on top-down structures, such as monarchies or states, Foucault redefines power as a networked phenomenon, operating at all levels of society. For example, in institutions like schools, hospitals, and prisons, power is embedded in the environment, routines, and norms that condition individuals to internalize authority ([source](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)).  

This section expands on the existing content by focusing on how power/knowledge operates not only institutionally but also through cultural norms and everyday practices. For instance, the medical establishment, as Foucault highlights, disciplines individuals by shaping their self-perceptions through diagnostic categories and treatments. This interplay between power and knowledge creates a framework where individuals are both subjects to and participants in the production of knowledge ([source](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)).  

### Mechanisms of Power: Sovereign Power, Biopower, and Disciplinary Power  

Foucault identifies three primary forms of power: sovereign power, biopower, and disciplinary power. Each operates differently but collectively illustrates the evolution of power in modern societies.  

#### Sovereign Power  

Sovereign power refers to the traditional, centralized authority of rulers, such as kings or emperors, who exercise control through laws and punishment. This form of power is characterized by its visible and repressive nature, often focused on the right to take life or impose death ([source](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)).  

#### Biopower  

Biopower, in contrast, emerges in modernity and focuses on regulating populations rather than individuals. It operates through institutions like public health systems, census-taking, and urban planning, aiming to optimize the life and productivity of the population. Biopower is less about repression and more about management, focusing on life rather than death ([source](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)).  

#### Disciplinary Power  

Disciplinary power, central to Foucault's analysis in *Discipline and Punish* (1975), operates on individuals by normalizing behavior through surveillance and routine. Institutions like schools and prisons exemplify this power by structuring time, space, and activities to produce docile bodies that conform to societal norms ([source](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)).  

This section builds on existing content by emphasizing the interconnectedness of these forms of power. For example, sovereign power may coexist with biopower in contemporary states, where governments both punish and regulate populations. Similarly, disciplinary power underpins biopower by shaping individuals who collectively form the population.  

### Critiques of Foucault's Power/Knowledge Framework  

Foucault's theory has been subject to significant critique, particularly regarding its implications for truth, agency, and resistance. Critics argue that if all knowledge is shaped by power, it becomes difficult to distinguish between truth and ideology. Joseph Rouse, for instance, questions how Foucault can critique power structures if his own knowledge is also a product of power ([source](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)).  

Another critique focuses on the lack of agency in Foucault's framework. By emphasizing the pervasive nature of power, Foucault risks portraying individuals as entirely conditioned by external forces, leaving little room for resistance or autonomy. Scholars like Mark Haugaard suggest that Foucault's account of power is overly structural and neglects the interactive and enabling aspects of power ([source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803)).  

This section extends the critique by exploring the implications for marginalized voices in academia. Foucault's framework, while highlighting the power dynamics in knowledge production, may inadvertently obscure the agency of those who resist dominant epistemologies. For example, feminist and postcolonial scholars have argued that Foucault's focus on Western institutions overlooks alternative knowledge systems and forms of resistance ([source](https://sserr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sserr-11-1-41-51.pdf)).  

### Applications of Power/Knowledge in Contemporary Contexts  

Foucault's theory has been widely applied in various fields, including education, healthcare, and governance. In higher education, for instance, his framework helps analyze how academic institutions function as sites of power and knowledge production. Universities, as hubs of research and teaching, shape societal norms and values by determining what knowledge is legitimate and who has the authority to produce it ([source](https://sserr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sserr-11-1-41-51.pdf)).  

In healthcare, Foucault's concept of biopower is particularly relevant. Public health campaigns, for example, use statistics and medical knowledge to regulate populations, promoting behaviors deemed beneficial while marginalizing others. This dynamic is evident in the management of pandemics, where governments rely on scientific expertise to enforce policies like lockdowns and vaccination mandates ([source](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)).  

This section introduces new examples, such as the role of algorithms in shaping knowledge in the digital age. Platforms like Google and Facebook use data to influence what information users encounter, effectively acting as gatekeepers of knowledge. This phenomenon illustrates how Foucault's insights into power/knowledge remain relevant in understanding contemporary power dynamics ([source](https://uscholar.univie.ac.at/detail/o:1208896.pdf)).  

### Temporal Dimensions of Power/Knowledge  

While Foucault is often associated with spatial analyses, his work also engages with the temporal dimensions of power/knowledge. He examines how historical shifts in power relations produce new forms of knowledge and subjectivity. For instance, the transition from sovereign power to biopower reflects a broader shift in the temporal focus of governance, from immediate control to long-term regulation ([source](https://uscholar.univie.ac.at/detail/o:1208896.pdf)).  

This section develops a Foucauldian vocabulary of temporal analysis, exploring how power/knowledge operates across time. For example, the concept of "temporal governmentality" examines how institutions manage time to discipline individuals. Schools, for instance, structure daily schedules to instill punctuality and productivity, shaping students' temporal habits ([source](https://uscholar.univie.ac.at/detail/o:1208896.pdf)).  

By incorporating temporal analysis, this section adds a new dimension to Foucault's theory, highlighting its applicability to critical social time studies. This perspective enriches our understanding of how power/knowledge shapes not only space but also the rhythms and durations of social life.


## Critiques and Limitations of Foucault's Theories

### Overemphasis on Structure and Neglect of Agency

One of the most prominent critiques of Michel Foucault's theories, particularly his conceptualization of power, is the perceived overemphasis on structural forces at the expense of individual agency. Foucault's work often portrays individuals as shaped by pervasive and anonymous power structures, leaving little room for autonomous action or resistance. For instance, in his analysis of disciplinary power, Foucault describes how individuals internalize norms through mechanisms like surveillance, effectively becoming self-regulating subjects ([Haugaard, 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803)). Critics argue that this approach reduces the individual to a passive entity, entirely conditioned by external forces, and fails to adequately theorize how individuals can act independently within or against these structures ([ScholarsArchive, 2024](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7744&context=etd)).

This critique is particularly relevant in the context of sociological theory, where the interplay between agency and structure is a central concern. Foucault's dismissal of the individual as the "elementary nucleus" of social analysis contrasts with perspectives that view the individual as an active agent capable of shaping, as well as being shaped by, social structures ([Haugaard, 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803)). While Foucault acknowledges the intentionality of power relations, he denies that these intentions originate from individual subjects, instead attributing them to broader, non-subjective systems of calculation ([Foucault, 1981](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803)). This perspective has been criticized for its lack of conceptual space for individual agency and for presenting a deterministic view of social life.

### Insufficient Engagement with Sociological Traditions

Foucault's theories have also been critiqued for their limited engagement with established sociological traditions and theorists. His analysis of power, for example, largely ignores the contributions of figures like Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, and Steven Lukes, despite their significant influence on the study of power and social structures ([Haugaard, 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803)). Critics argue that this lack of engagement leads to a one-sided account of power that overemphasizes its structural and repressive aspects while neglecting its interactive and enabling dimensions.

For instance, Weber's concept of legitimate authority and Lukes' three-dimensional model of power both highlight the role of consent and agency in the exercise of power, offering a more nuanced understanding than Foucault's predominantly structural approach. By contrast, Foucault's focus on power as a diffuse and omnipresent force risks obscuring the ways in which individuals and groups actively participate in power dynamics ([Haugaard, 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803)).

This critique extends to Foucault's methodological approach, which relies heavily on historical and philosophical analysis but often lacks the empirical rigor associated with sociological research. While this approach allows for innovative insights, it also limits the applicability of Foucault's theories to empirical studies of contemporary social phenomena ([Systemic Sustainability, 2025](https://systemicsustainability.wordpress.com/2025/01/07/michel-foucault-in-the-modern-context/)).

### Gender and Feminist Critiques

Foucault's work has been critiqued by feminist scholars for its androcentric bias and insufficient attention to gendered experiences of power. While Foucault's analysis of power-knowledge dynamics has been influential in feminist theory, particularly in deconstructing patriarchal norms and institutions, critics argue that his framework often marginalizes women's experiences and overlooks the specific ways in which power operates along gendered lines ([ScholarsArchive, 2024](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7744&context=etd)).

For example, in *The History of Sexuality*, Foucault focuses on the ways in which power shapes discourses of sexuality but largely neglects the female sexual experience. Feminist scholars have pointed out that this omission undermines the potential of his work to address issues such as sexual violence, reproductive rights, and the intersection of gender and power ([ScholarsArchive, 2024](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7744&context=etd)). Carolyn Dean, for instance, critiques Foucault's privileging of discourse over lived experience, arguing that this approach sacrifices the agency and subjectivity of marginalized groups in favor of abstract theoretical constructs ([ScholarsArchive, 2024](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7744&context=etd)).

Moreover, Foucault's radical anti-essentialism, while valuable in challenging fixed notions of identity, has been criticized for undermining feminist efforts to reclaim the body and assert authentic desires. By rejecting the idea of "spontaneous" feelings or innate motivations, Foucault's framework risks reinforcing the very forms of marginalization it seeks to critique ([ScholarsArchive, 2024](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7744&context=etd)).

### Ambiguities in the Concept of Resistance

Another limitation of Foucault's theories lies in the ambiguity surrounding the concept of resistance. While Foucault famously asserts that "where there is power, there is resistance," he provides little guidance on how resistance can be effectively organized or sustained. This vagueness has led some critics to question the practical applicability of Foucault's ideas for social and political activism ([Systemic Sustainability, 2025](https://systemicsustainability.wordpress.com/2025/01/07/michel-foucault-in-the-modern-context/)).

Foucault's later works, such as *The Care of the Self*, attempt to address this issue by exploring the possibilities for individual autonomy and ethical self-formation within power structures. However, these "practices of the self" are often criticized for being overly individualistic and disconnected from collective forms of resistance. Critics argue that by focusing on personal transformation, Foucault's framework fails to account for the structural and systemic changes needed to challenge entrenched power relations ([Systemic Sustainability, 2025](https://systemicsustainability.wordpress.com/2025/01/07/michel-foucault-in-the-modern-context/)).

This critique is particularly relevant in the context of contemporary social movements, where collective action and solidarity are essential for addressing issues such as racial inequality, climate change, and economic injustice. Foucault's emphasis on dispersed and localized forms of power makes it difficult to conceptualize how large-scale resistance can be coordinated or how systemic change can be achieved ([Systemic Sustainability, 2025](https://systemicsustainability.wordpress.com/2025/01/07/michel-foucault-in-the-modern-context/)).

### Challenges in Distinguishing Truth from Ideology

Finally, Foucault's assertion that all knowledge is shaped by power has been critiqued for its epistemological implications. If truth is always a product of power relations, it becomes difficult to distinguish between truth and ideology or to justify critiques of existing power structures. This issue is particularly problematic for scholars and activists who seek to challenge dominant narratives and advocate for alternative forms of knowledge ([Haugaard, 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803)).

Joseph Rouse, for example, questions how Foucault can critique power structures if his own knowledge is also a product of power. This paradox undermines the critical potential of Foucault's framework and raises questions about the possibility of objective or universal truths ([Haugaard, 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803)). Additionally, Foucault's focus on the contingent and constructed nature of knowledge has been criticized for neglecting the material and practical dimensions of truth, such as its role in addressing social injustices or advancing scientific progress ([Systemic Sustainability, 2025](https://systemicsustainability.wordpress.com/2025/01/07/michel-foucault-in-the-modern-context/)).

In summary, while Foucault's theories have profoundly influenced contemporary thought, they are not without significant limitations. These critiques highlight the need for a more balanced approach that integrates individual agency, engages with diverse sociological traditions, and addresses the practical challenges of resistance and truth in the context of power.


## Impact and Contemporary Applications of Foucault's Work

### Foucault's Influence on Mental Health Practices

Michel Foucault's methodological approach, particularly his concept of the "history of the present," has significantly influenced contemporary mental health care. This approach emphasizes understanding current practices and institutions through their historical development, thereby uncovering the power dynamics embedded within them. In mental health care, Foucault's analysis of how societal norms define "madness" and "normalcy" has led to a critical examination of diagnostic practices and institutional frameworks ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27862651/)).

For example, Foucault's critique of psychiatric institutions in *Madness and Civilization* has inspired reforms aimed at deinstitutionalization and the promotion of community-based care. His ideas encourage mental health professionals to adopt critical thinking skills that challenge traditional hierarchies and power structures within the field. This has been particularly relevant in the shift towards recovery-oriented and patient-centered care models, which emphasize collaboration and empowerment over paternalistic approaches ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27862651/)).

Moreover, Foucault's concept of biopower—how states regulate populations through health and medicine—has been applied to analyze public health campaigns and policies, such as vaccination drives and mental health awareness initiatives. These analyses reveal how such campaigns, while beneficial, can also reinforce social control by defining acceptable behaviors and marginalizing dissenting voices ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27862651/)).

### Applications in Higher Education Research

Foucault's power/knowledge framework has become a cornerstone for analyzing the dynamics of higher education institutions. His theories provide a lens to examine how universities function as sites of knowledge production, dissemination, and legitimization. Unlike the existing report's focus on general applications in higher education, this section delves into the specific challenges and opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and its impact on academia.

In the 4IR era, characterized by rapid technological advancements, universities are increasingly seen as hubs of innovation and power dynamics. Foucault's framework helps scholars investigate how academic disciplines are shaped by funding priorities, technological imperatives, and global competition. For instance, the prioritization of STEM fields over the humanities reflects broader societal power structures that value certain types of knowledge over others ([SSERR](https://sserr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sserr-11-1-41-51.pdf)).

Additionally, Foucault's ideas have been instrumental in critiquing the corporatization of higher education. As universities adopt business models, concerns arise about the commodification of knowledge and the marginalization of critical, non-market-oriented research. Foucault's emphasis on inclusivity and equity provides a theoretical foundation for advocating diverse and transformative research practices ([SSERR](https://sserr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sserr-11-1-41-51.pdf)).

### Biopolitics and Governmentality in Public Policy

Foucault's concepts of biopolitics and governmentality have profoundly shaped the analysis of public policy, particularly in areas like health, security, and governance. Biopolitics refers to the ways in which states manage populations through policies that regulate life and health, while governmentality examines the techniques and rationalities employed in governance.

One contemporary application of these concepts is in the management of global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Foucault's insights into how states use medical knowledge to exercise control over populations have been used to critique lockdown measures, vaccination mandates, and contact tracing technologies. These measures, while aimed at protecting public health, also raise ethical concerns about surveillance, individual freedoms, and the balance of power between citizens and the state ([Tandfonline](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803)).

Another area where Foucault's ideas are relevant is in the analysis of welfare policies. Governmentality provides a framework to understand how welfare programs not only address social needs but also shape citizens' behaviors and identities. For example, unemployment benefits often come with conditions that require recipients to actively seek work, thereby reinforcing societal norms about productivity and self-reliance ([Sociologija](https://www.sociologija.org/admin/published/2024_66/4/871.pdf)).

### Foucault's Legacy in Gender and Postcolonial Studies

While Foucault's work has been critiqued for its androcentric bias, it has also been adapted and expanded by feminist and postcolonial scholars to address issues of gender and colonial power dynamics. This section builds on existing critiques by exploring how Foucault's concepts have been reinterpreted to highlight marginalized perspectives.

Feminist theorists have used Foucault's analysis of power and discourse to deconstruct patriarchal norms and institutions. For instance, his concept of biopower has been applied to understand how reproductive rights and healthcare policies regulate women's bodies. However, these scholars also critique Foucault for failing to adequately address the gendered dimensions of power, arguing that his framework needs to be supplemented with insights from feminist theory ([Sociologija](https://www.sociologija.org/admin/published/2024_66/4/871.pdf)).

Similarly, postcolonial scholars have drawn on Foucault's ideas to analyze the legacy of colonialism in shaping contemporary power relations. His concept of governmentality has been particularly useful in examining how colonial administrations used census data, maps, and legal systems to control and categorize colonized populations. This has led to a deeper understanding of how colonial power continues to influence global inequalities and cultural hierarchies ([Sociologija](https://www.sociologija.org/admin/published/2024_66/4/871.pdf)).

### Ethical Self-Formation and Resistance

Foucault's later works, such as *The Care of the Self*, explore the possibilities for ethical self-formation within power structures. This section expands on existing discussions of resistance by focusing on the practical applications of Foucault's ideas for individual and collective agency.

Foucault's concept of "practices of the self" emphasizes the importance of personal autonomy and ethical self-care as forms of resistance to dominant power structures. These practices involve critically examining one's beliefs and behaviors to achieve greater self-awareness and freedom. For example, in the context of consumer culture, individuals can resist the commodification of identity by adopting minimalist lifestyles or supporting ethical consumption practices ([Epitome Journals](https://www.epitomejournals.com/VolumeArticles/FullTextPDF/317_Research_Paper.pdf)).

Collective forms of resistance, such as social movements, also draw on Foucault's insights into power and discourse. Activists use his theories to challenge dominant narratives and create alternative spaces for marginalized voices. For instance, environmental movements often critique the neoliberal framing of nature as a resource to be exploited, advocating instead for sustainable and community-centered approaches ([Epitome Journals](https://www.epitomejournals.com/VolumeArticles/FullTextPDF/317_Research_Paper.pdf)).

By focusing on both individual and collective strategies, this section highlights the practical relevance of Foucault's ideas for addressing contemporary challenges.

## Conclusion

Michel Foucault's theories on power and knowledge provide a transformative framework for understanding the intricate relationship between authority, truth, and societal structures. Central to his argument is the concept of power/knowledge, which posits that power and knowledge are mutually constitutive, shaping societal norms, institutions, and individual subjectivities. Unlike traditional hierarchical views of power, Foucault emphasizes its diffuse and networked nature, operating through institutions, cultural norms, and everyday practices. His identification of sovereign power, biopower, and disciplinary power illustrates the evolution of governance, from overt control to more subtle forms of regulation and normalization. These insights remain highly relevant, particularly in analyzing contemporary phenomena such as public health policies, higher education, and the role of digital platforms in shaping knowledge and behavior ([Foucault, 1975](https://www.perlego.com/knowledge/study-guides/foucaults-theory-of-power-knowledge/)).

However, Foucault's framework is not without critique. Scholars have raised concerns about his overemphasis on structural forces, which can obscure individual agency and collective resistance. Feminist and postcolonial theorists have further critiqued his androcentric bias and limited engagement with marginalized perspectives, while others question the epistemological implications of his claim that all knowledge is shaped by power. Despite these limitations, Foucault's work has been widely applied across disciplines, from mental health care to public policy, offering critical tools to interrogate power dynamics and challenge dominant narratives. Future research could address these critiques by integrating Foucault's insights with theories of agency, intersectionality, and collective action, thereby expanding the applicability of his ideas to contemporary social and political challenges ([Haugaard, 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803); [ScholarsArchive, 2024](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7744&context=etd)).

In sum, Foucault's theories continue to offer profound insights into the mechanisms of power and their impact on knowledge production and societal organization. While his work invites critical engagement and refinement, its enduring relevance lies in its ability to illuminate the subtle and pervasive ways in which power operates, enabling scholars and practitioners to critically examine and resist oppressive systems in diverse contexts ([Systemic Sustainability, 2025](https://systemicsustainability.wordpress.com/2025/01/07/michel-foucault-in-the-modern-context/)).

He is recognized as one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period[1\u2020]. His theories primarily address the relationships between power and knowledge, and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions[1\u2020][2\u2020].\\n\\nSource: https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/philosophy-biographies/michel-foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault | Encyclopedia.com\\nContent: Foucault\\'s work continues to have significance for historical, literary, and philosophical study. In his later years Foucault wrote and spoke extensively on varying topics ranging from language to the relations of knowledge and power. In the span of a short career Foucault had considerable impact on the intellectual world. Yet given the complexity, subtly, and eclecticism of his style, the full impact of his work has yet to be realized.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n\\nFoucault is included in Contemporary Authors (volumes 105,113). Obituaries can be found in Newsweek (July 9, 1984) and TIME (July 9, 1984). For helpful works on Foucault see Alan Sheridan, Michel Foucault: The Will to Truth (Tavistock, 1980) and Hubert L.

His personal life was marked by his experiences with mental health and his exploration of his sexuality[2\u2020][5\u2020][3\u2020].\\nFoucault\u2019s struggles with mental health began during his time at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where he suffered from acute depression[2\u2020][3\u2020]. These experiences led him to seek psychiatric help[2\u2020][10\u2020][3\u2020]. His encounters with psychiatry, both personally and professionally, would later influence his philosophical views on power, knowledge, and the social institutions that govern these concepts[2\u2020].\\n\\nSource: https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/philosophy-biographies/michel-foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault | Encyclopedia.com\\nContent: Foucault, Michel\\n\\nFoucault, Michel 1926-1984\\n\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n\\nMichel Foucault was a French philosopher who wrote widely on the history of thought. His influences include philosophers of science, such as his mentor Georges Canguilhem, but also Maurice Blanchot and Friedrich Nietzsche, from whom he derived his influential methodological notion of genealogy. Though Foucault\u2019s oeuvre treats seemingly disparate historical topics ranging from psychiatry to structuralism and on from sexuality to liberalism, a concern with the issues of knowledge and power as they constellate around the formation of subjectivities forms a constant, discernible thread.\\n\\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\\nContent: Conclusion and Legacy\\nMichel Foucault\u2019s legacy is vast and influential, extending across various fields of study, including sociology, philosophy, and critical theory. His work has resonated in the field of security studies, foregrounding the biopolitical imperative at the heart of liberal governance[11\u2020]. His ideas have been instrumental in understanding how institutions, through the use of discourse, create subject categories for people to inhabit, turning people into objects of scrutiny and knowledge[4\u2020].\\nFoucault\u2019s key intellectual contribution was his ability to illustrate that institutions like science, medicine, and the penal system, through the use of discourse, create subject categories for people to inhabit, and turn people into objects of scrutiny and knowledge[4\u2020]. His work has inspired sociologists in subfields including sociology of knowledge; gender, sexuality and queer theory; critical theory; deviance and crime; and the sociology of education.\\n\\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\\nContent: First Publication of His Main Works\\nMichel Foucault\u2019s work has had a profound impact on a wide range of disciplines, and his major works have shaped fields such as sociology, philosophy, and history of ideas[2\u2020][1\u2020]. Here are some of his main works:\\n\\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\\nContent: Foucault\u2019s works have been influential in shaping several academic subfields, including the sociology of knowledge, gender studies, queer theory, critical theory, deviance and crime, and the sociology of education[2\u2020][4\u2020].\\nAnalysis and Evaluation\\nMichel Foucault\u2019s work has been the subject of extensive analysis and evaluation. His theories on power, knowledge, and discourse have significantly influenced a wide range of academic disciplines[7\u2020][8\u2020].\\nFoucault\u2019s concept of \u2018discursive practice\u2019 has been applied to fields such as educational evaluation[7\u2020]. His perspective suggests that evaluation technologies can be seen as an expression of \u2018the will to power\u2019, leading to a critical examination of these technologies[7\u2020].\\n\\nSource: https://iep.utm.edu/foucault/\\nTitle: Foucault, Michel | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\nContent: \u00d7search\\xa0\\nMichel Foucault (1926\u20131984)\\nMichel Foucault was a major figure in two successive waves of 20th century French thought\u2013the structuralist wave of the 1960s and then the poststructuralist wave. By the premature end of his life, Foucault had some claim to be the most prominent living intellectual in France.\\nFoucault\u2019s work is transdisciplinary in nature, ranging across the concerns of the disciplines of history, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. At the first decade of the 21st century, Foucault is the author most frequently cited in the humanities in general. In the field of philosophy this is not so, despite philosophy being the primary discipline in which he was educated, and with which he ultimately identified. This relative neglect is because Foucault\u2019s conception of philosophy, in which the study of truth is inseparable from the study of history, is thoroughly at odds with the prevailing conception of what philosophy is.\\n\\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\\nContent: Career Development and Achievements\\nAfter graduating in 1952, Foucault began a career marked by constant movement, both professional and intellectual[1\u2020][2\u2020]. He first taught at the University of Lille, then spent five years (1955\u201360) as a cultural attach\u00e9 in Uppsala, Sweden; Warsaw, Poland; and Hamburg, West Germany (now Germany)[1\u2020][2\u2020]. Foucault defended his doctoral dissertation at the ENS in 1961[1\u2020][2\u2020].\\nHis first major book, \u201cThe History of Madness\u201d (1961), won critical praise but a limited audience[1\u2020]. After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France, he produced \u201cThe Birth of the Clinic\u201d (1963) and \u201cThe Order of Things\u201d (1966), publications that displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism, from which he later distanced himself[1\u2020][2\u2020]. These first three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing called \"archaeology\"[1\u2020][2\u2020].\\n\\nSource: https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/philosophy-biographies/michel-foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault | Encyclopedia.com\\nContent: Michel Foucault was born on October 15, 1926, in Pottiers, France, the son of Paul (a doctor) and Anne (Malapert) Foucault. He studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure and at the University of Paris, Sorbonne, where he received his diploma in 1952. He served as director of the Institut Francais in Hamburg and held academic posts at the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand and Paris-Vincennes. In 1970 he became professor and chairman of the History of Systems of Thought at the College de France. A creative thinker, Foucault made substantial contributions to philosophy, history, literary criticism, and, specifically, to theoretical work in the human sciences. Often depicted as a \"structuralist,\" a designation he disavowed, Foucault had something of a following among French intellectuals. He died from a neurological disorder on June 25, 1984, cutting short a brilliant career.\\n Source: https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/144151611.pdf\\nTitle: Surveillance, Knowledge and Inequality: Understanding Power Through Foucault and Beyond.\\nContent: The Hilltop Review\\nVolume 8\\nIssue 1 Fall 2015\\nArticle 3\\nDecember 2015\\nSurveillance, Knowledge and Inequality:\\nUnderstanding Power Through Foucault and\\nBeyond.\\nSimon Purdy\\nWestern Michigan University\\nFollow this and additional works at: http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/hilltopreview\\nPart of the Inequality and Stratification Commons, Social Control, Law, Crime, and Deviance\\nCommons, and the Theory, Knowledge and Science Commons\\nThis Article is brought to you for free and open access by ScholarWorks at\\nWMU.

Foucault draws upon an anti-Enlightenment\\ntradition that rejects the equation of reason, emancipation, and progress, arguing that an\\ninterface between modern forms of power and knowledge has served to create new forms of\\ndomination. In a series of historico-philosophical studies, he has attempted to develop and\\nsubstantiate this theme from various perspectives: psychiatry, medicine, punishment and\\ncriminology, the emergence of the human sciences, the formation of various disciplinary\\napparatuses, and the constitution of the subject.

I revise our understanding of Foucault by countering the influential misinterpretations\\nproffered by his European interlocutors such as Habermas and Derrida. Central to Foucault\u2019s\\naccount of modernity was his work on two crucial concept pairs: freedom/power and reason/mad-\\nness. I argue against the view of Habermas and Derrida that Foucault understood modern power\\nand reason as straightforwardly opposed to modern freedom and madness. I show that Foucault\\nheld a much more complex view of these pairs, a view encapsulated in his term \u2018reciprocal incom-\\npatibility\u2019. By revising our interpretation of Foucault\u2019s work on modernity in this way, we open the\\nway to much more effective deployments of his critical apparatus.\\nKeywords\\n\\nSource: https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/postmoderntheorych2.pdf\\nTitle: \\nContent: 41\\nPostmodern Theory - Chapter 2\\nFoucault and the Critique of Modernity\\nIs it not necessary to draw a line between those who believe that we can\\ncontinue to situate our present discontinuities within the historical and\\ntranscendental tradition of the nineteenth century and those who are making a\\ngreat effort to liberate themselves, once and for all, from this conceptual\\nframework?

Postmodernists attacked the attempt by Enlightenment philosophers and others to discover allegedly objective moral values that could serve as a standard for assessing different political systems or for measuring political progress from one historical period to another. According to Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard (1924\u201398), for example, this project represents a secular faith that must be abandoned. In La Condition postmoderne (1979; The Postmodern Condition) and other writings, Lyotard declared his suspicion of what he called \u201cgrand narratives\u201d\u2014putatively rational, overarching accounts, such as Marxism and liberalism, of how the world is or ought to be.

Foucault\\'s theories primarily addressed the relationships between power versus knowledge and liberty, and he analyzed how they are used as a form of social control through multiple institutions. Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels and sought to critique authority without limits on himself.[10] His thought has influenced academics within a large number of contrasting areas of study, with this especially including those working in anthropology, communication studies, criminology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, psychology, and sociology.

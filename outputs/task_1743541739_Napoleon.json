Many historians have blamed Napoleon\\'s poor planning, but Russian scholars instead emphasize the Russian response, noting the notorious winter weather was just as hard on the defenders.[18]\\nAmerican historian Paul Schroeder (1927\u20132020) is willing to grant that Napoleon was a genius regarding \"military, administrative, organizational, political, even literary [efforts] ...

President Emmanuel Macron has praised him, saying that \"Napoleon is the man who gave shape to our political and administrative organization, to the uncertain sovereignty that emerged from the Revolution. ... After months of failure, with France besieged, Napoleon was able to incarnate order.\"[30] The remarks were criticized, especially on the issues of Haiti, slavery and race. Macron subsequently clarified his comments, stating that the restoration of slavery in 1802 was a \"mistake, a betrayal of the spirit of the Enlightenment\".[31]\\nLong-term influence outside France[edit]\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_Napoleon\\nTitle: Legacy of Napoleon - Wikipedia\\nContent: In the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe\" or \"a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler\".[4] Napoleon had grandiose foreign policy ambitions across Europe and the Americas.[citation needed] The Continental powers as late as 1808 were willing to give him nearly all of his gains and titles, but he was overly aggressive and pushed for too much, until his empire collapsed.[5][6]\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_Napoleon\\nTitle: Legacy of Napoleon - Wikipedia\\nContent: Critics argue Napoleon\\'s true legacy must reflect the loss of status for France and needless deaths brought by his rule: historian Victor Davis Hanson writes, \"After all, the military record is unquestioned\u201417 years of wars, perhaps six million Europeans dead, France bankrupt, her overseas colonies lost.\"[13] McLynn states that, \"He can be viewed as the man who set back European economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars.\"[7] Vincent Cronin replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that Napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name, when in fact France was the victim of a series of coalitions that aimed to destroy the ideals of the Revolution.[14]\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_Napoleon\\nTitle: Legacy of Napoleon - Wikipedia\\nContent: Although Napoleon ended lawlessness and disorder in post-Revolutionary France, his enemies attacked him as a tyrant and usurper.[7] His critics charge that he was not troubled when faced with the prospect of war and death for thousands, turned his search for undisputed rule into a series of conflicts throughout Europe and ignored treaties and conventions alike.

This created a collective memory that influenced, and continues to influence, the modern world in a myriad of ways. The conflicts were a continuation of the French Revolutionary Wars, which bear their own collective and historical memory. They involved nearly every power in Europe, affecting them each to varying degrees. Political and legal systems changed, both as a result of Revolutionary ideals and the introduction of the Code Napol\u00e9on. Nationalism and national identity formation accelerated during the period, often benefiting from opposition to Napoleon or the destruction of existing systems wrought by the Revolutionary spirit that French armies brought to occupied territories, spurring the creation of national memory wherever they appeared.

He led the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then ruled the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1814, and briefly again in 1815.\\n\\nSource: https://www.history.com/articles/napoleon\\nTitle: Napoleon Bonaparte - Biography, Facts & Death | HISTORY\\nContent: Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821), also known as Napoleon I, was a French military leader and emperor who conquered much of Europe in the early 19th century. Born on the island of Corsica, Napoleon rapidly rose through the ranks of the military during the French Revolution (1789-1799). After seizing political power in France in a 1799 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, he crowned himself emperor in 1804. Shrewd, ambitious and a skilled military strategist, Napoleon successfully waged war against various coalitions of European nations and expanded his empire. However, after a disastrous French invasion of Russia in 1812, Napoleon abdicated the throne two years later and was exiled to the island of Elba. In 1815, he briefly returned to power in his Hundred Days campaign. After a crushing defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, he abdicated once again and was exiled to the remote island of Saint Helena, where he died at 51.\\nNapoleon\u2019s Education and Early Military Career\\n\\nSource: https://www.worldhistory.org/Napoleon_Bonaparte/\\nTitle: Napoleon Bonaparte - World History Encyclopedia\\nContent: by Harrison W.

He established the largest continental European empire since Charlemagne and brought liberal reforms to the lands he conquered at the cost of the destructive Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815).\\n\\nSource: https://www.worldhistory.org/Napoleon_Bonaparte/\\nTitle: Napoleon Bonaparte - World History Encyclopedia\\nContent: Follow us on YouTube!\\nNapoleon is best remembered for his military career, over the course of which he fought 60 battles and lost only seven. His military innovations changed European warfare; he utilized conscription, popularized the implementation of corps as an army\\'s largest unit, and pioneered certain military tactics that have been studied ever since. He is often ranked alongside Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar as one of history\\'s most brilliant generals. He also implemented a set of civil laws, best known as the Napoleonic Code, that was adopted throughout much of continental Europe and influenced the judicial systems of many modern nations. Alternatively viewed as a reformer and an autocrat, a warmonger and a defender of liberties, Napoleon enjoys a controversial reputation but remains one of Western history\\'s best-known figures.\\nRemove Ads\\nAdvertisement\\nEarly Life\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon\\nTitle: Napoleon - Wikipedia\\nContent: Jump to content\\nMain menu\\nSearch\\nAppearance\\nDonate\\nCreate account\\nLog in\\nPersonal tools\\n        Photograph your local culture, help Wikipedia and win!\\nToggle the table of contents\\nNapoleon\\n211 languages\\nArticle\\nTalk\\nRead\\nView source\\nView history\\nTools\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\n\"Napoleon Bonaparte\" redirects here.

His legacy endures through the modernizing legal and administrative reforms he enacted in France and Western Europe, embodied in the Napoleonic Code. He established a system of public education,[2] abolished the vestiges of feudalism,[3] emancipated Jews and other religious minorities,[4] abolished the Spanish Inquisition,[5] enacted the principle of equality before the law for an emerging middle class,[6] and centralized state power at the expense of religious authorities.[7] His conquests acted as a catalyst for political change and the development of nation states. However, he is controversial due to his role in wars which devastated Europe, his looting of conquered territories, and his mixed record on civil rights. He abolished the free press, ended directly elected representative government, exiled and jailed critics of his regime,\\n\\nSource: https://www.worldhistory.org/Napoleon_Bonaparte/\\nTitle: Napoleon Bonaparte - World History Encyclopedia\\nContent: Napoleon after his Abdication at Fontainebleau Paul Delaroche (Public Domain)\\n\\nSource: https://www.britannica.com/summary/Napoleon-I\\nTitle: Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s military career, dictatorship, and imperial rule | Britannica\\nContent: Written and fact-checked by\\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica Encyclopaedia Britannica\\'s editors oversee subject areas in which they have extensive knowledge, whether from years of experience gained by working on that content or via study for an advanced degree.

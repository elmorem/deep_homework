He is remembered for his method of using historical research to illuminate changes in discourse over time, and the evolving relationships between discourse, knowledge, institutions, and power. Foucault\u2019s work inspired sociologists in subfields including sociology of knowledge; gender, sexuality and queer theory; critical theory;\\xa0\\xa0deviance and crime; and the sociology of education. His most well-known works include Discipline and Punish, The History of Sexuality, and The Archaeology of Knowledge.\\n\\nEarly Life\\n\\nSource: https://iep.utm.edu/foucault/\\nTitle: Foucault, Michel | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\nContent: Foucault\u2019s work can generally be characterized as philosophically oriented historical research; towards the end of his life, Foucault insisted that all his work was part of a single project of historically investigating the production of truth. What Foucault did across his major works was to attempt to produce an historical account of the formation of ideas, including philosophical ideas. Such an attempt was neither a simple progressive view of the history, seeing it as inexorably leading to our present understanding, nor a thoroughgoing historicism that insists on understanding ideas only by the immanent standards of the time. Rather, Foucault continually sought for a way of understanding the ideas that shape our present not only in terms of the historical function these ideas played, but also by tracing the changes in their function through history.\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nSource: https://iep.utm.edu/foucault/\\nTitle: Foucault, Michel | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\nContent: \u00d7search\\xa0\\nMichel Foucault (1926\u20131984)\\nMichel Foucault was a major figure in two successive waves of 20th century French thought\u2013the structuralist wave of the 1960s and then the poststructuralist wave. By the premature end of his life, Foucault had some claim to be the most prominent living intellectual in France.\\nFoucault\u2019s work is transdisciplinary in nature, ranging across the concerns of the disciplines of history, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. At the first decade of the 21st century, Foucault is the author most frequently cited in the humanities in general. In the field of philosophy this is not so, despite philosophy being the primary discipline in which he was educated, and with which he ultimately identified. This relative neglect is because Foucault\u2019s conception of philosophy, in which the study of truth is inseparable from the study of history, is thoroughly at odds with the prevailing conception of what philosophy is.\\n\\nSource: https://www.thoughtco.com/michel-foucault-biography-3026478\\nTitle: Michel Foucault Biography and Intellectual History\\nContent: Intellectual Legacy\\n\\nFoucault\\'s key intellectual contribution was\\xa0his deft ability to illustrate that institutions--like science, medicine, and the penal system--through the use of discourse, create subject categories for people to inhabit, and turn people into objects of scrutiny and of knowledge. Thus, he argued, those who control institutions and their discourses wield power in society, because they shape the trajectories and outcomes of people\\'s lives.\\n\\nSource: https://www.thoughtco.com/michel-foucault-biography-3026478\\nTitle: Michel Foucault Biography and Intellectual History\\nContent: Early Life\\n\\nPaul-Michel Foucault was born to an upper-middle-class family in Poitiers, France in 1926. His father was a surgeon, and his mother, the daughter of a surgeon. Foucault attended Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV, one of the most competitive and demanding high schools in Paris. He recounted later in life a troubled relationship with his father, who bullied him for being \u201cdelinquent.\u201d In 1948 he attempted suicide for the first time and was placed in a psychiatric hospital for a period. Both of these experiences seem tied to his homosexuality, as his psychiatrist believed his suicide attempt was motivated by his marginalized status in society. Both also seem to have shaped his intellectual development and focus on the discursive framing of deviance, sexuality, and madness.\\n\\nIntellectual and Political Development\\n\\nSource: https://iep.utm.edu/foucault/\\nTitle: Foucault, Michel | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\nContent: 1. Life\\nMichel Foucault was born Paul-Michel Foucault in 1926 in Poitiers in western France. His father, Paul-Andr\u00e9 Foucault, was an eminent surgeon, who was the son of a local doctor also called Paul Foucault. Foucault\u2019s mother, Anne, was likewise the daughter of a surgeon, and had longed to follow a medical career, but her wish had to wait until Foucault\u2019s younger brother as such a career was not available for women at the time. It is surely no coincidence then that much of Foucault\u2019s work would revolve around the critical interrogation of medical discourses.\\n\\nSource: https://iep.utm.edu/foucault/\\nTitle: Foucault, Michel | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\nContent: David Macey.\\xa0Michel Foucault.\\xa0London : Reaktion Books, 2004.\\nA readable, abbreviated biography of Foucault.\\n\\n\\nMichael Mahon.\\xa0Foucault\u2019s Nietschean Genealogy: Truth, Power, and the Subject.\\xa0Albany: SUNY Press, 1992.\\nA pointedly philosophical work on the influence of Nietzsche on Foucault.\\n\\n\\nJeremy Moss (ed.).The Later Foucault.

During these decades Foucault became known as an engaged public intellectual and activist on behalf of social justice issues, including racism, human rights, and prison reform. He was very popular with his students, and his lectures given after his induction into the Coll\u00e8ge de France were considered highlights of intellectual life in Paris, and always packed.\\n\\nIntellectual Legacy\\n\\nSource: https://iep.utm.edu/foucault/\\nTitle: Foucault, Michel | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\nContent: 6. Ethics\\nFoucault\u2019s final years lecturing at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, the early 1980s, saw Foucault\u2019s attention move from modern reflections on government, first to Christian thought, then to Ancient. Foucault is here following the genealogy of government, but there are other factors at work. Another reason for this trajectory is the History of Sexuality project, for which Foucault found it necessary to move further and further back in time to trace the roots of contemporary thinking about sex. However, one might ask why Foucault never found it necessary to do this with any other area, for example madness, where doubtless the roots could have been traced further back. Another reason for this turn, then, at this time was a changed climate in French academe, where, the political militancy of the seventies in abeyance, there was a general \u201cturn to ethics.\u201d\\n Source: https://medium.com/@jenniwalfordbcn/exploring-michel-foucaults-discipline-and-punish-power-control-and-the-birth-of-the-modern-c6cfc5a47b03\\nTitle: Michel Foucault\u2019s Discipline and Punish: The Hidden Architecture of Control in Modern Society | by Jenni Walford | Medium\\nContent: Conclusion\\nMichel Foucault\u2019s Discipline and Punish offers an eye-opening critique of how society controls individuals through discipline, surveillance, and the accumulation of knowledge. His concepts, such as the Panopticon and docile bodies, remain highly relevant in today\u2019s digital age, where surveillance and the collection of personal data are commonplace. By reflecting on how these ideas play out in our own lives, we can better understand the subtle ways we are shaped by society\u2019s power structures and how we might resist them.\\n\\nSource: https://www.philosopheasy.com/p/panopticism-and-power-how-surveillance\\nTitle: Panopticism and Power: How Surveillance Shapes Society according to Michel Foucault\\nContent: Share this post\\n\\nPanopticism and Power: How Surveillance Shapes Society according to Michel Foucault\\n\\nShare this post\\n\\nMichel Foucault, one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, profoundly shaped our understanding of power, knowledge, and societal control.

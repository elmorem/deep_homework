Before this analysis can commence, however, some background is needed with regards to the military terms referenced in the introduction, so as to create the context needed to approach the larger thesis. First, in the modern understanding, there are three levels to warfare: strategy, operations, and tactics.6 At the lowest end lies tactics, the level of combat.

Upon a selection, the dispersed divisions would rapidly reconcentrate upon a single carefully selected point, maneuvering with rapidity and precision to envelop and annihilate the chosen enemy force.16 To achieve this end, Napoleon employed three\\n\\nSource: https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&context=aujh\\nTitle: \\nContent: to the other two maneuvers, it consisted of smashing through a defensive cordon to seize a center of operations.20 These operational maneuvers were designed to construct a favorable environment for battle, for which, tactically, there was but one goal, annihilation. As such, all Napoleonic battles were centered on the offensive with the utmost importance placed on achieving an envelopment of the enemy.21 There were three principal types of Napoleonic battles: 1) the frontal assault, used when necessitated by the geographic environment, 2) the double battle, the strategy of central position writ small, and 3) the strategical battle, Napoleon\u2019s favorite.22 A tactical approach designed to secure an envelopment and destroy the enemy, the strategical battle began with a vanguard moving forward to pin the enemy line. This frontal assault would then draw in the enemy\u2019s reserve as ever more French soldiers would commit to the attack.

First, la manoeuvre sur les derri\u00e8res - An operational maneuver used against a single enemy army. In this case, Napoleon would deploy a small detachment to assault the enemy and pin it in place while maneuvering his main army to turn the flank of the enemy army and from there cut off its retreat. At this point, Napoleon would rapidly advance on the enemy rear forcing them to either surrender or give battle on Napoleon\u2019s terms. 17 Second, the strategy of central position- An operational maneuver used when the French were faced by two or more enemy armies.

Moving quickly allowed Napoleon to fight enemy forces one at a time, rather than letting them come together to use their united weight of numbers. Even in his eventual defeat in the Hundred Days, he managed to avoid fighting the Prussians and English together until the end of the Battle of Waterloo, the dying moments of his campaign.\\n\\nThe way Napoleon\u2019s armies moved was hardly unprecedented.

Napoleonic Warfare, itself, refers to the comprehensive system of waging wars constructed by Napoleon. Regarding strategy, Napoleon\u2019s only objective was the rapid destruction of the enemy\u2019s army in battle.9 His was a philosophy of warfare which demanded that an army remain on the strategic offensive, a reality that in turn colored Napoleon\u2019s operational and tactical precepts.10 Each operation, each maneuver, and each battle was carefully designed to create the circumstance for a decisive engagement, a battle of annihilation.

The Eagle\u2019s Rise: Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s First Campaign and the Birth of Napoleonic Warfare Berke Gursoy Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) The study of the military science has always been viewed through the lens of the great captains, through those few who by their skill redefined warfare.1 Scholars and generals alike have delved into the lives of these figures, searching near and far to coax out of their experience the secrets to the art of war. Napoleon himself advised his officers to \u201cread and re-read the campaigns of Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus Adolphus, Turenne, Prince Eugene, and of Frederick,\u201d2 a pantheon of elites to whose number subsequent generations have added the French Emperor.3 However, in surveys of the Napoleonic Wars, what is often neglected by scholars is Napoleon\u2019s\\n\\nSource: https://www.warhistoryonline.com/napoleon/napoleon-really-military-innovator-x.html\\nTitle: The Military Innovations Of One Of The Most Terrifying European Conquerors, Napoleon Bonaparte | War History Online\\nContent: Usually consisting of between 20,000 and 30,000 men and led by one of the empire\u2019s prestigious marshals, these corps were effectively small armies in their own right. Because of their scale and high-level leadership, they could achieve swift and flexible strategic maneuvers while still facing an army when required.

Many Napoleonic tactics were developed by ancien r\u00e9gime royalist strategists like Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval; Jean-Pierre du Teil; Jacques Antoine Hippolyte; and Pierre-Joseph Bourcet.[2] They emphasised the \"flexible use of artillery\" and they \"abandoned marching in lines (which maximised a unit\\'s firepower) in favour of attacking in columns.\"[3]\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_tactics\\nTitle: Napoleonic tactics - Wikipedia\\nContent: Napoleonic tactics\\n\\nNapoleonic tactics describe certain battlefield principles used by national armies from the late 18th century until the invention and adoption of the rifled musket in the mid 19th century. Napoleonic tactics are characterised by intense drilling of soldiers; speedy battlefield movement; combined arms assaults between infantry, cavalry, and artillery; relatively small numbers of cannon; short-range musket fire; and bayonet charges.[1] French Emperor Napoleon I is considered by military historians to have been a master of this particular form of warfare. Military powers would continue to employ such tactics even as technological advancements during the industrial revolutions gradually rendered them impractically obsolete, leading to devastating losses of life in the American Civil War, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I.\\n\\nContents\\n\\nInfantry tactics\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_tactics\\nTitle: Napoleonic tactics - Wikipedia\\nContent: Infantry in the battlefield\\n\\nMost Napoleonic battles took place on farm fields, villages, roads, and streams; French troops regarded cities, mountains, swamps, and heavy woods as unsuitable combat arenas. Commanders, such as the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, sought out terrain suitable for their forces. Infantry regiments used three primary battle formations: column formation, line formation, and infantry square (square formation).\\n\\nThe column formation was narrow and long, suited for soldiers marching down a road or moving quickly towards the enemy across an open field. Because the column formation was a large target for muskets and cannon, regiments would normally change formation as the enemy drew closer.\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_tactics\\nTitle: Napoleonic tactics - Wikipedia\\nContent: Many soldiers on Napoleonic battlefields were coerced into staying in battle. To overcome their individual inclination to self-preservation and to provide effective firepower, the infantry regiments fought shoulder-to-shoulder, at least two or three lines deep, firing in volleys. The officers and non-commissioned officers carried swords and halberds which could be used to keep the infantrymen in the firing line. Should a soldier shirk duty and flee from the field of battle, each army normally had a picket line of cavalry at its rear encouraging the soldier to return to their regiment. To assist with command and control of the infantry, each soldier would wear a colourful military uniform visible from a distance, even through the black-powder clouds hovering over the battlefield. Napoleon did not underestimate the importance of morale and said once that, \"Moral force rather than numbers decides victory.\"[5]\\n\\nInfantry in the battlefield\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_tactics\\nTitle: Napoleonic tactics - Wikipedia\\nContent: the tides on the battlefield.[11] After the reorganisation of the army into corps, the French Army established semi-autonomous artillery formations that were led and coordinated by artillery officers.

The short effective range, long reload times, and rapid fouling of the smoothbore musket meant that cavalry units could quickly close in on infantry units before the horsemen could be overwhelmed with musket fire. Cavalry units were also responsible for fixing enemy forces in place, typically by charging at infantry units which would respond by forming into semi-static \"squares\". If the infantry unit failed to form square, quite often they would be overrun by the charging cavalry and forced to flee the battlefield en masse. Cavalry units often fought against other cavalry units to essentially neutralise one another. The speed of cavalry units made them capable of surprising enemy forces, especially as these battlefields were often covered in thick smoke generated by the black powder muskets, cannon, and howitzer.[7] Cavalry units also protected generals and\\n\\nSource: https://www.usafa.edu/app/uploads/Harmon28.pdf\\nTitle: 1\\nContent: In his campaigns Napoleon always relied upon surprise and speed.  \"It is,\" he wrote, \"a well \\nestablished maxim of war never to do what the enemy wishes you to do.\"8 He also believed that \"the \\nstrength of an army like power in mechanics is the product of the mass by the velocity.\"9  Similarly,\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_tactics\\nTitle: Napoleonic tactics - Wikipedia\\nContent: The Napoleonic era saw many developments in field artillery. Field artillery (also known as light artillery) is a class of mobile artillery that backs up armies on the battlefield. These guns were developed with an emphasis towards maneuverability, mobility, accuracy over long distance, and speed.[8] Mobile artillery advancements date back to King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in the Thirty Years\\' War (1618\u201348).[9] Adolphus is recognised as being the first military commander to mass his light artillery units into batteries and to employ them in combination with other arms.[10] By the mid-18th century, commanders from various nations had arrived at the conclusion that mobile artillery that could accompany the rest of the army was a necessity.[9] No longer would artillery\\'s influence be limited to its immediate firing range.

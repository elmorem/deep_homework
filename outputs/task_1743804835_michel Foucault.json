He is recognized as one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period[1\u2020].

His personal life was marked by his experiences with mental health and his exploration of his sexuality[2\u2020][5\u2020][3\u2020].\\nFoucault\u2019s struggles with mental health began during his time at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where he suffered from acute depression[2\u2020][3\u2020]. These experiences led him to seek psychiatric help[2\u2020][10\u2020][3\u2020]. His encounters with psychiatry, both personally and professionally, would later influence his philosophical views on power, knowledge, and the social institutions that govern these concepts[2\u2020].\\n\\nSource: https://ondertexts.com/en/biography/michel-foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Biography by Ondertexts\\nContent: Conclusion and Legacy\\nMichel Foucault\u2019s legacy is vast and influential, extending across various fields of study, including sociology, philosophy, and critical theory. His work has resonated in the field of security studies, foregrounding the biopolitical imperative at the heart of liberal governance[11\u2020]. His ideas have been instrumental in understanding how institutions, through the use of discourse, create subject categories for people to inhabit, turning people into objects of scrutiny and knowledge[4\u2020].\\nFoucault\u2019s key intellectual contribution was his ability to illustrate that institutions like science, medicine, and the penal system, through the use of discourse, create subject categories for people to inhabit, and turn people into objects of scrutiny and knowledge[4\u2020].

He has had strong influence not only in philosophy but also in a wide range of humanistic and social scientific disciplines.\\n\\nSource: https://iep.utm.edu/foucault/\\nTitle: Foucault, Michel | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\nContent: \u00d7search\\xa0\\nMichel Foucault (1926\u20131984)\\nMichel Foucault was a major figure in two successive waves of 20th century French thought\u2013the structuralist wave of the 1960s and then the poststructuralist wave. By the premature end of his life, Foucault had some claim to be the most prominent living intellectual in France.\\nFoucault\u2019s work is transdisciplinary in nature, ranging across the concerns of the disciplines of history, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. At the first decade of the 21st century, Foucault is the author most frequently cited in the humanities in general. In the field of philosophy this is not so, despite philosophy being the primary discipline in which he was educated, and with which he ultimately identified. This relative neglect is because Foucault\u2019s conception of philosophy, in which the study of truth is inseparable from the study of history, is thoroughly at odds with the prevailing conception of what philosophy is.\\n\\nSource: https://iep.utm.edu/foucault/\\nTitle: Foucault, Michel | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\nContent: Foucault\u2019s work can generally be characterized as philosophically oriented historical research; towards the end of his life, Foucault insisted that all his work was part of a single project of historically investigating the production of truth. What Foucault did across his major works was to attempt to produce an historical account of the formation of ideas, including philosophical ideas. Such an attempt was neither a simple progressive view of the history, seeing it as inexorably leading to our present understanding, nor a thoroughgoing historicism that insists on understanding ideas only by the immanent standards of the time. Rather, Foucault continually sought for a way of understanding the ideas that shape our present not only in terms of the historical function these ideas played, but also by tracing the changes in their function through history.\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nSource: https://www.college-de-france.fr/en/chair/michel-foucault-history-of-systems-of-thought-statutory-chair/biography\\nTitle: Biography and publications | Michel Foucault - History of systems of thought | Coll\u00e8ge de France\\nContent: Biography\\nMichel Foucault is a French philosopher, born onOctober15\\xa01926 in Poitiers. Rejecting the medical studies his surgeon father envisioned for him, he studied philosophy and psychology at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure on rue d\\'Ulm from 1946 onwards.

Here are some of his main works:\\n\\nSource: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault | French Philosopher, Historian & Social Theorist | Britannica\\nContent: Why is Michel Foucault important?\\nMichel Foucault was one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period. The first volume of\\xa0his work The History of Sexuality\\xa0became\\xa0canonical\\xa0for gay and lesbian\\xa0studies and queer theory. Through his work, the terms\\xa0discourse,\\xa0genealogy, and\\xa0power-knowledge\\xa0became entrenched in contemporary social and cultural research.\\n\\nWhere was Michel Foucault educated?\\nA distinguished but sometimes erratic student, Michel Foucault gained entry at the age of 20 to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) in\\xa0Paris\\xa0in 1946.

While Foucault contends that there is no center of power, his account of power remains top-down or structural, missing the interactive and enabling aspects of power. A more balanced view would suggest that all exercises of power include meaningful agency (the ability to do something); social structures (not simply as constraints but as interactive creations); social knowledge (including both reifying truth claims and enabling truth or knowledge); and social-ontological being-in-the-social-world (both as enabling and dominating).\\nKeywords:\\n\\nFoucault\\nagency\\ndomination\\npower\\nstructure\\n\\nSource: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\\nTitle: Just a moment...\\nContent: Full article: Foucault and Power: A Critique and Retheorization\\nSkip to Main Content\\n\\n\\nBrowse\\n\\nSearch\\nClose search\\n\\n\\nPublish\\n\\nWhy publish with us?\\nFind a journal\\nSearch calls for papers\\nJournal Suggester\\nStep-by-step guide\\nOpen access publishing\\n\\nWe\u2019re here to help\\nFind guidance on Author Services\\n\\n\\nLogin \\xa0|\\xa0 Register\\nLog in or Register\\n\\nLogin\\nRegister\\n\\nCart Add to Cart\\nSearch, Browse, or PublishClose Menu\\n\\n\\nSearch\\nClose search\\n\\n\\nBrowse\\n\\n\\nPublish\\n\\nWhy publish with us?\\nFind a journal\\nSearch calls for papers\\nJournal Suggester\\nStep-by-step guide\\nOpen access publishing\\n\\nWe\u2019re here to help\\nFind guidance on Author Services\\n\\n\\nHome\\n\\nAll Journals\\nCritical Review\\nList of Issues\\nVolume 34, Issue 3-4\\nFoucault and Power: A Critique and Rethe ....\\n\\nSearch in: \\nAdvanced search\\n\\nSource: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\\nTitle: Just a moment...\\nContent: Search in: \\nAdvanced search\\n\\nCritical Review\\nA Journal of Politics and Society\\nVolume 34, 2022 - Issue 3-4: New Perspectives on Foucault\\nJournal homepage\\nOpen access\\n39,194\\nViews\\n8\\nCrossRef citations to date\\n0\\nAltmetric\\nListen\\nResearch Article\\nFoucault and Power: A Critique and Retheorization\\nMark HaugaardCorrespondencemark.haugaard@nuigalway \\nPages 341-371 | Published online: 03 Nov 2022\\n\\nCite this article\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\\n\\n CrossMark\\n\\n\\nFull Article\\n\\nFigures & data\\nReferences\\nCitations\\nMetrics\\nLicensing\\nReprints & Permissions\\nView PDF (open in a new window) PDF (open in a new window) View EPUB (open in a new window) EPUB (open in a new window)\\n\\nSource: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\\nTitle: Just a moment...\\nContent: One can see this in theoretical terms by asking: Where does disciplinary power come from? The answer, in line with Foucault\u2019s injunction not to theorize in terms of a center of power, cannot be power elites or social forces enacting their own telos. From a sociological perspective, then, we need to explore the active agency of social subjects who embrace discipline in order to realize certain strategic objectives rather than simply seeing these actors as the effects of power or structure. Indeed, while Foucault insists that there is no center of power, it is striking that all the institutions that he describes are state institutions. Contrary to his rhetoric, his works create a sense of an all-encompassing state beyond the visible state\u2014a thing-in-itself center that disciplines society by creating docile subjects.\\n\\nSource: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\\nTitle: Just a moment...\\nContent: Foucault presents discipline as opposed to freedom. In reality, in complex interdependent societies, self-discipline is the vehicle of socially constrained freedom. In the modern workplace, where technology, information, and best practices change constantly, success depends upon a lifetime preoccupation with gaining diplomas, certificates, and degrees. These serve as educational capital that is rewarded by promotion in the workplace. The constantly deferred gratification that this requires stems from the agency of the subject in pursuit of authority power. Of course, there is a bureaucratic disciplinary matrix adjudicating these pursuits. Nevertheless, the Foucauldian image of pastoral power does not capture the resulting dynamic. For all the bureaucratization of the modern world, its subjects are not dupes of higher powers. Nor is internalized self-discipline necessarily unjust.\\n\\nSource: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\\nTitle: Just a moment...\\nContent: In his account of subject formation through discipline, Foucault writes about the \u201cdisciplining of societies in Europe since the eighteenth century\u201d (Foucault Citation1982, 229). Yet if there is no center of power, as Foucault maintains, who or what is doing the disciplining? The only plausible answer, consistent with a balance between agency and structure, relates to social actors\u2019 strategic responses to their structural context. Social actors are not mere dupes of some super-structure; they are purposive agents who use discipline strategically to give themselves some perceived relational advantage in interactions with others.\\n\\nSource: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\\nTitle: Just a moment...\\nContent: Erikson, Erik. 1995.

The key to understanding why social actors often voluntarily subject themselves to constraints is that these have enabling aspects. Power is Janus-faced: interactive power relations are both empowering and dominating. In Discipline and Punish, Foucault refers to Bentham\u2019s suggestion that Panoptical discipline could be used in one school to teach children correct mathematics and astronomy, while in another they are disciplined to learn that \u201ctwo and two do not make four or that the moon is a cheese\u201d (Foucault Citation1979, 204).

I think there is some truth to that defense. The fact that he appears blissfully unaware of the likes of Weber, Durkheim, and Lukes means that some of his insights are refreshingly original. For this reason, I aim to take what is interesting and insightful in Foucault and make it better by reframing some of his insights about power in relation to sociological theory and the power debates. However, before I do so, I wish to briefly sketch why Foucault\u2019s innocence of sociological theory makes his analysis of power problematic, and therefore in need of improvement.\\nAgency and Structure\\n\\nSource: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2022.2133803\\nTitle: Just a moment...\\nContent: Foucault, Michel. 1982. \u201cThe Subject and Power.\u201d Afterword in Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics, ed.

Rather than assuming a linear progression or a singular truth, genealogy uncovers the messy, contingent, and often contradictory processes through which power operates. Drawing inspiration from Nietzsche\u2019s concept of genealogy, Foucault emphasizes that history is not a march toward progress but a battlefield where power struggles and conflicting forces shape societal norms.\\n\\nFor Foucault, genealogy is about understanding \u201chow\u201d power works rather than \u201cwhy.\u201d It examines the emergence of societal norms, institutions, and practices to reveal the hidden mechanisms of control. This method rejects grand narratives, focusing instead on localized and contextual histories to demonstrate how power is dispersed and embedded in the fabric of everyday life.\\n\\nSource: https://sociology.institute/sociological-theories-concepts/foucault-genealogy-power-beyond-surface/\\nTitle: Foucault\\'s Genealogy: Power Beyond the Surface \u2022 Sociology Notes by Sociology.Institute\\nContent: Foucault\u2019s Genealogy: Power Beyond the Surface\\n\\nMichel Foucault\u2019s genealogical writings mark a transformative shift in his work, offering a profound critique of how power operates beneath the surface of society. By delving into the intersections of social, political, and economic institutions, Foucault\u2019s genealogy explores how power shapes individuals and structures our modern world. In this blog, we\u2019ll unpack the concept of genealogy, understand how it differs from his earlier archaeological method, and examine key works like Discipline and Punish to understand the mechanisms of disciplinary power.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nUnderstanding genealogy in Foucault\u2019s work \ud83d\udd17\\n\\nSource: https://genealogiesofmodernity.org/journal/2021/6/8/what-foucault-meant\\nTitle: Genealogies of Modernity \u2014 What Foucault Meant When He Said \u201cGenealogy\u201d\\nContent: This background allows us to make two observations about Foucault\u2019s terminology. First, when Foucault says \u201cgenealogy,\u201d he does not mean the natural sciences\u2019 method of studying heritability. And he is more interested in the aristocratic, rather than the bourgeois approach, to heredity. This first observation affords a second: Foucault contrasts the science of genetics to aristocratic genealogy. And he adopts the aristocratic version of genealogy\u2014concerned with sanguinity for political purposes\u2014as the model for his analogical use of the term to name his own historical method. When Foucault says \u201cgenealogy,\u201d he is thinking of aristocratic genealogy.\\n\\nThese observations enable us to parse this mature statement of Foucault\u2019s genealogical method:\\n\\nSource: https://sociology.institute/sociological-theories-concepts/foucault-genealogy-power-beyond-surface/\\nTitle: Foucault\\'s Genealogy: Power Beyond the Surface \u2022 Sociology Notes by Sociology.Institute\\nContent: Implications of Foucault\u2019s genealogy \ud83d\udd17\\n\\nFoucault\u2019s genealogical writings challenge us to rethink power as something far more complex and dispersed than a simple top-down model.

He contrasts his genealogical method to any evolutionary model of history. His genealogy is not interested in heredity except insofar as a hermeneutics of heredity expresses political opportunity. Like aristocratic families, disciplines, institutions, and practices are constituted by and transmit themselves through alliances and networks of other disciplines, institutions, and practices.\\n\\nSource: https://genealogiesofmodernity.org/journal/2021/6/8/what-foucault-meant\\nTitle: Genealogies of Modernity \u2014 What Foucault Meant When He Said \u201cGenealogy\u201d\\nContent: Considered in these terms, Foucault\u2019s genealogy has a great deal in common with medieval analysis of genealogy using trees of consanguinity. Heredity is taken for granted (but it is not the point). Unlike a family tree, there is no single origin (because origins are not the point). Rather, the tree of consanguinity measures relative proximity and distance between individuals, lineages, and generations. Proximity and distance determine possibility. The tree of consanguinity visualizes the limit cases, the fringe of possibility where relation passes from taboo to opportunity, the degree of separation where \u201cmarriage is restored.\u201d\\n\\nSource: https://genealogiesofmodernity.org/journal/2021/6/8/what-foucault-meant\\nTitle: Genealogies of Modernity \u2014 What Foucault Meant When He Said \u201cGenealogy\u201d\\nContent: What Foucault Meant When He Said \u201cGenealogy\u201d\\n\\nWhen Michel Foucault was up for a coveted job at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1969, he proposed to teach a course on the history of the science of heritability, \u201cstarting from breeding techniques, on through attempts to improve species, experiments with intensive cultivation, efforts to combat animal and plant epidemics, and culminating in the establishment of a genetics whose birth date can be placed at the beginning of the twentieth century.\u201d He did get the job, and although the course never came about, research for it made its way into the first volume of The History of Sexuality.\\n\\nThere Foucault observes the contrast between two models of heredity in the nineteenth century: aristocratic genealogy that tracked bloodlines and bourgeois genealogy that attended to the health and vitality of the body.\\n\\nSource: https://genealogiesofmodernity.org/journal/2021/6/8/what-foucault-meant\\nTitle: Genealogies of Modernity \u2014 What Foucault Meant When He Said \u201cGenealogy\u201d\\nContent: The question Foucauldian genealogy asks is not how one cultural or social formation descended from others but how and to what extent it is related to and co-constitutive of others. (For the sake of clarity, I am oversimplifying Foucault\u2019s understanding of institutions and practices.) Foucault is particularly interested in limit cases when an institution\u2019s latent contingency comes to expression and opportunities for new alliances, networks, and formations emerge. The sinister example he discusses in The History of Sexuality is the emergence of eugenics as an exercise of biopower using the new tools of genetics.\\n Source: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-bar-foundation-research-journal/article/abs/foucaults-discipline-and-punish-an-exposition-and-critique/D06D179F726FADC025C451C6D51B64B8\\nTitle: Foucault\\'s Discipline and Punish An Exposition and Critique | American Bar Foundation Research Journal | Cambridge Core\\nContent: 47\\nIn The History of Sexuality, Vol.1, supra note 1, the study which followed Discipline and Punish, Foucault turns his attention to the way in which social discourses and practices work to bring about the \u201csubjectification\u201d of individuals, i.e., to create them as persons with a particular kind of subjectivity. Although some of Discipline and Punish\\'s arguments allude to this process, Discipline and Punish is more explicitly concerned with what might be termed the \u201cobjectification\u201d of individuals. See Gordon, Colin, The Birth of the Subject, in Radical Philosophy, No. 17 (Summer 1977). This later work also develops an important conception Foucault terms \u201cbio-politics.\u201d This refers to those strategies of government that concern themselves with the life, health, efficiency, and security of whole populations.

The posthumously published History of Sexuality began this surprising turn. As we will see, however, theoretical-methodological decisions blocked his access to the original phenomena, that is, the masters of eros from Plato to Augustine.

To that, one could add his enthusiastic endorsement of Mao\u00e2\\x80\\x99s Cultural Revolution. Apropos of the first misguided endorsement, the young French political philosopher Pierre Manent conducted what later came to be known as a \u00e2\\x80\\x9cfisking\u00e2\\x80\\x9d of Foucault\u00e2\\x80\\x99s Iranian effusions.

Foucault\\'s theories primarily addressed the relationships between power versus knowledge and liberty, and he analyzed how they are used as a form of social control through multiple institutions. Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels and sought to critique authority without limits on himself.[10] His thought has influenced academics within a large number of contrasting areas of study, with this especially including those working in anthropology, communication studies, criminology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, psychology, and sociology.

With genealogy, Foucault set out to unearth the artificiality of the dividing line between the putatively illegitimate and its putatively normal and natural opposite. Discipline and Punish was his genealogical expos\u00e9 of the artifices of power-knowledge that had resulted in the naturalization of the \u201ccriminal character,\u201d and the first volume of Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9 (1976; The History of Sexuality) was his expos\u00e9 of the Frankensteinian machinations that had resulted in the naturalization of the dividing line between the \u201chomosexual\u201d and the \u201cheterosexual.\u201d Yet even in these luminous \u201chistories of the present\u201d something still remained out of view: human freedom.

Foucault subsequently published The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the Coll\u00e8ge de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in several left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and other violations of human rights, focusing on struggles such as penal reform. Foucault later published Discipline and Punish (1975) and The History of Sexuality (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods that emphasized the role that power plays in society.\\n\\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault\\nTitle: Michel Foucault - Wikipedia\\nContent: Philosophical work\\nSee also: Michel Foucault bibliography\\nFoucault\\'s colleague Pierre Bourdieu summarized the philosopher\\'s thought as \"a long exploration of transgression, of going beyond social limits, always inseparably linked to knowledge and power\".[187]\\nThe theme that underlies all Foucault\\'s work is the relationship between power and knowledge, and how the former is used to control and define the latter. What authorities claim as \\'scientific knowledge\\' are really just means of social control. Foucault shows how, for instance, in the eighteenth century \\'madness\\' was used to categorize and stigmatize not just the mentally ill but the poor, the sick, the homeless and, indeed, anyone whose expressions of individuality were unwelcome.\\n\u2014\\u200aPhilip Stokes, Philosophy: 100 Essential Thinkers (2004)[188]\\n', 'cost_callback': <bound method HomeworkResearcher.add_costs of <homework_researcher.agent.HomeworkResearcher object at 0x13b377680>>}'",
